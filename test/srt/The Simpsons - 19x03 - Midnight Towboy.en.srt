Okay, Maggie. Say your "good nights."

Good night, Teddy Bear.
Good night, Justin Timberwolf.

Good night, Bedtime Krusty.

9
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:40,525
Don't let the bedbugs bite!

10
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:42,977
Krusty's Anti-Bedbug Spray sold
separately

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,135
May contain poison.

12
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:46,301
Good night, Maggie.

13
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,775
Come on, sweet.
Everyone's going to sleep.

14
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:56,515
You know you make me wanna. Shout!
Throw my hands up and Shout!

15
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,509
Kick my heels up and Shout!

16
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:00,325
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey

17
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,326
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey

18
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,884
A little bit louder now

19
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:05,511
A little bit louder now

20
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:07,780
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey...

21
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,684
All right, I'll make you another bottle.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,537
Maggie's so clingy.

23
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:24,550
Homer, hold her while I pour the milk.

24
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:25,969
No problem.

25
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:29,459
My, you've grown.

26
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:39,885
Spilled milk?

27
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:47,282
All over the floor.

28
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,621
Hey, Apu, what happened
to all your milk?

29
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:54,277
I sold it all to teenagers.

30
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:58,062
There's a rumor you can mix
milk, Mentos and Lotto scrapings

31
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:59,401
to make jetpack fuel.

32
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:01,890
- Does it work?
- Kinda.

33
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,655
Hey, Moe! Got any milk?

34
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,165
It's either milk or paint.

35
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:15,889
It's paint. Or is it?

36
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,628
Yeah, it's paint.

37
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,515
Well, then I'll have
to charge you extra,

38
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:23,018
depending on the color.
Uh, stick out your tongue.

39
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,658
Eggshell? No.

40
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:26,843
Malabar ivory? No.

41
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,350
Mediterranean ecru? No.

42
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:31,984
Ah! Here it is... white.

43
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,689
Ooh, that's gonna cost ya.

44
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,048
There must be a Website that can
help you deal with a clingy baby.

45
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,741
Oh, I don't want to bother
the Internet with my problem.

46
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:42,982
Aw, come on, Mom. We'll help you surf.

47
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,669
- Click that one, Mom.
- No, go up.

48
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:46,679
- Keep going up, up, up!
- The blue ones are ads.

49
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:48,740
- That's the toolbar.
- Now you've opened Word; close it.

50
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,096
- Close it. Do-Don't save it.
- Stop clicking.

51
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:53,262
- Don't go there!
- Why are you buying a freezer?

52
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,259
Don't click the cart
or you've bought it!

53
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,831
Aw, you clicked the cart.

54
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,717
If you're so smart, you do it.

55
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,339
CLINGY BABY? We Can Help

56
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,606
C.R.I.E? What does that stand for?

57
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:09,728
"Creative Responses
for Infant Edu-loving!"

58
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,686
Ooh, "edu-loving!"

59
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:14,288
They come to your home to help
you raise "independent,

60
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:17,462
"self-actualized children.
"The counselors can come

61
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:20,387
day and night because they
have no families themselves."

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,272
Okay, I'll sign up.

63
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,023
You just bought another freezer.

64
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:26,127
Well, maybe I wanted another freezer!

65
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,431
I've got to find milk somewhere.

66
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:30,137
SHELBYVILLE NO MILK

67
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:33,698
OGDENVILLE MILK-FREE SINCE '73

68
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:36,778

WELCOME TO GUIDOPOLIS
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?

71
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:54,659
DINER

72
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,608
STOLEN AUTO PARTS

73
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:03,466
MOOK-E-MART

74
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:09,897
You want milk?!
I got your milk right here.

75
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:14,535
At first I thought you were
pointing to your crotch.

76
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,455
You thought, huh? Yo, everybody!

77
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,397
Get a load of "Beautiful Mind"
over here, with the thinkin'.

78
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,838
Listen up, ya humps!

79
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,782
Which one of youz parked at the bank?

80
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,347
'Cause they're towing your sorry ass.

81
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,164
That's my car!

82
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,505
Yo, Angelica. Get over here.

83
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:39,325
This don't mean nothing.

84
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:41,505
LOUIE'S TOWING

85
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,607
Ah, please! Give me a break!

86
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:46,692
I've been driving all night,
looking for milk for my kids.

87
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,747
I'll tell you what. I'll give you
a ride to the impound lot.

88
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:52,078
Okay, let me just grab my registration.

89
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,151
I can't believe your boss lets you
listen to rock music while you work.

90
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:06,542
My boss?

91
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:10,641
I don't think my boss has
a problem with anything I do.

92
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,151
Oh, I'd really like to meet this guy.

93
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,403
Well, he's in this truck right now.

94
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,822
But it's just you and me.

95
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:24,020
That must mean... I'm your boss!

96
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,916
I'm sick of you! You're fired!

97
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,530
No, you dumb Dominick. I'm my own boss.

98
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:30,139
Shut up!

99
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:32,177
When you call in sick, who do you call?

100
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,095
I don't call in sick.
I work when I want to.

101
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,921
Sometimes you want to work?

102
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:39,494
Hey, I get to drive around,
eat what I want,

103
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,209
eyeball the highway honeys...

104
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,021
I'm your aunt, stupid!

105
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,685
...and lasso the street cattle.

106
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,455
- Street cattle?
- The cars I tow,

107
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,184
I got all kinds of names for them:

108
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:51,104
She-atas, Hebrew canoes,

109
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:53,352
spam cans, Swedish speedballs,

110
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:55,505
and of course, stretch lame-os.

111
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,605
Some of those were pretty funny.

112
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:02,073
Check it out. We already got
a "whine line."

113
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:03,490
When can I get my Beamer?

114
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:06,908
I can't be out in this neighborhood!
My jewelry's real!

115
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,473
You can't tow a hybrid.

116
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:11,354
My blow better still be
in the glove box.

117
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,309
Wow, you make people miserable

118
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:16,419
and there's nothing they can do
about it! Just like God.

119
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:19,918
Man, oh, man, you got
the greatest job in the world.

120
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:23,193
You know, if you're interested,

121
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,961
we could use another hook jockey.

122
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:26,894
The Springfield territy's wide open,

123
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,731
since Flatbed Fred got killed

124
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:30,812
in that murder-murder-murder-suicide.

125
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:34,642
I would love to! Oh, but I
don't have a tow truck.

126
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,458
For 500 bucks, I'll sell you
this old bucket.

127
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:41,394
Hmm... I'm not sure my wife will go
for this naughty mud flaps.

128
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,966
Not to worry.

129
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:45,403
These... are the ones you show at home.

130
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:48,078
That's still too sexy for my wife.

131
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:49,374
No problem.

132
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:53,918
Man, you work as a silhouette
model for one day

133
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,989
and it haunts you
for the rest of your life.

134
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:57,722
Now just rember two rules.

135
00:06:57,871 --> 00:06:59,712
One, stick to Springfield.

136
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:02,053
If I catch you on my turf,
I'll rip off your head,

137
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,991
vomit down your neck,
pull out your heart,

138
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,817
show it to your head,
then shove 'em both

139
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,414
down your neck hole,
to which I previously alluded.

140
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,647
"...which I previously alluded..."
Are there two "L's" in "alluded"?

141
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:14,214
Rule number two, always keep
your hook pointed out.

142
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,248
Why? What happens
if I point it this way?

143
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:20,335
- Ohello-o! - Hello!
- Hello, Captain Hook!

144
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:23,715
- Oh, spoil sport.
- Oh, you're no fun.

145
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:33,101
Ah, my first tow.

146
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:36,997
I think it goes... here.

147
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:48,267
Ah, my first tow.

148
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,046
Stop. Stop. I'm entitled to park there.

149
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:57,265
Really? What's your handicap?

150
00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:00,508
Pogonophobia...
fear of beards and mustaches.

151
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:06,280
Well, I guess I can call a cab.

152
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,697
Stay back! All of ya!

153
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,014
Faster! More dangerous!

154
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:41,100
Marge, your codependent hyper-nurturing

155
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:42,859
has infantilized your baby.

156
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,829
You've made her queen of her "clingdom."

157
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,948
Ooh, did you hear that, Maggie-wags?

158
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:48,227
You're a queen.

159
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:50,028
Marge, you're reinforcing a negative.

160
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,168
I'm what?

161
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,696
Allow me to demonstri-care.

162
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:55,577
Actualize!

163
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,705
And now you are free
to live like a human being.

164
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:08,327
Maggie's crying.

165
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,222
She's not crying, she's celebrating
her independence.

166
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,600
Don't crash that party.

167
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:15,265
Oh... one hug can't hurt.

168
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,702
Yes, it can... hugs are drugs,
and your daughter's an addict.

169
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:23,817
I guess it's time to let
my little girl grow up.

170
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:29,862
You see?

171
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:33,000
Now her childhood can begin-ualize.

172
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,625
Huh. Thank you, CRIE.

173
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:38,352
I'm, huh, I'm sorry about the kick.

174
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,612
I've never done anything
like that before.

175
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,688
Yeah, well, I'm glad your first
time was such a success.

176
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:47,947
What the hell are you doing?

177
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,457
I'm doing my job.

178
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:51,305
You're hovering over a hydrant.

179
00:09:57,425 --> 00:10:00,251
You're in the sky now... my domain.

180
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:15,173
I've got tow dough I'm looking
to blow, Moe.

181
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:18,562
I'm buying a round
of the fanciest drink you got.

182
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:20,966
Four "Lobster-politans" comin' up.

183
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,788
Here's to Homer and the cars he towed.

184
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:37,920
With those jerks out of the way,
I was able to park right outside.

185
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,233
Outside? That's a one-hour parking zone,

186
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:44,592
and you've been here a good 81 minutes.
Correction: a great 81 minutes.

187
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:47,144
'Cause nothing beats hangin'
around with old friends,

188
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:49,868
drinkin' lobster-based
designer drinks and...

189
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,051
Huh, good joke, Homer.

190
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,482
You can unhook my car now.

191
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,829
Uh, looks like
he's driving away with it.

192
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,014
No, he's just moving it
so it won't get towed.

193
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:23,247
Maggie, what can I
get you for breakf...?

194
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:26,618
You did everything yourself.

195
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,417
Homer, where have you been?

196
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:32,250
Marge, when you're married
to a midnight towboy,

197
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:34,175
you might not see him for days on end.

198
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:35,952
I don't want to live like that.

199
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,877
Hey, when you married a man
who would, years later,

200
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,328
without warning, become
a tow truck driver,

201
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,927
you knew what the deal
would eventually be.

202
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,062
Well, no one's disputing that.

203
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,557
Guess what, boy? Last night I towed
your principal's car.

204
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:52,013
Oh, awesome. How's he getting around?

205
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,636
You can't impound my spirit.

206
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:03,674
Top of the mornin', Tow-mer.

207
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,093
It's Homer,idiot.

208
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:10,085
So it is. I'm just here to pay
the fine for the Sunday School Bus.

209
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:12,124
You towed it with the kids still in it.

210
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:16,313
I guess I'm more powerful than God now.

211
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:20,007
You know what they say: "With great
power comes great responsibility."

212
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:23,537
Who said that?!
I'll kill them with my power.

213
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,361
Take that, you tow-talitarian.

214
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,762
Doesn't that joke make
light of totalitarians?

215
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:32,888
Yeah. Stalin put my grandmother

216
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:34,994
in a forced labor camp for 20 years.

217
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:37,037
Look, I was insensitive, and I'm sorry.

218
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,431
But what this is really about
is a bully with a winch.

219
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:42,820
If I'd wanted the laws of this
town enforced to the letter,

220
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,492
I wouldn't have hired fatty here
as police chief.

221
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:48,047
Hear that, Ralphie?
The mayor knows daddy.

222
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:49,998
All right, listen up.

223
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:52,314
I know a thing or two about tow-Joes.

224
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:55,546
I married three of them,
and they're real territorial.

225
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:57,562
Now here's the plan...

226
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,629
Get in here, Mel. I don't bite.

227
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,166
I might gum ya, and you might like it.

228
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,038
WELCOME TO GUIDOPOLIS

229
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:15,683
YOU'RE STILL IN SPRINGFIELD

230
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:19,741
Must we all wait behind this bush?
I have theater tickets.

231
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,581
Ooh, theater tickets, huh?

232
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:22,961
Now ya got nothin'.

233
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:41,200
Maggie's completely independent.

234
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:44,769
At least you need me, sack of potatoes.

235
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,028
Oh my God...

236
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:08,097
multiple tickets, handicapped spot,

237
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,850
parked by a hydrant,
incomprehensible vanity plate.

238
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:15,274
If my life as a tow truck driver
were a teleplay,

239
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,836
this would be the end of act two.

240
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:30,309
I told you to stay off my turf!

241
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:32,204
What? I'm still in Sprigfield.

242
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,833
Wha...?! Okay, I made a mistake.

243
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,541
Why don't you give me two
demerit points in a point system

244
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:41,764
we work out right now?

245
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:43,094
D'oh!

246
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:46,015
END OF ACT 2

247
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:53,155
Put me down, you lousy... Wee!

248
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,699
Okay, I'm warning you... Wee!

249
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:59,937
I'll kill you, you son of a... Wee!

250
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:02,242
All right buddy, that's it,

251
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,021
I've had... Wee!

252
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,778
Oh, wee...

253
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:14,311
You... let go!

254
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:16,884
All right,

255
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,658
Just... let... go.

256
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:23,471
Oh, a trap door. What's down there?

257
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,381
- Your Meatball collection?
- Good-bye.

258
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:28,699
I thought we were friends!
I was kidding you in a friendly fashion!

259
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,170
- Who are you guys?
- We're just like you...

260
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,533
tow truck drivers who got greedy.

261
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,866
Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?

262
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,396
No. We're waiting for him
to give us a timeshare presentation.

263
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,359
Actually, we're an a cappella group

264
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:46,436
and we're gonna sing
"Under the BoardWalk."

265
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:49,062
The truth is, we're just waiting
for each others' hair to grow

266
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:50,301
so we can braid it.

267
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,878
Okay, I get it. I'm not stupid.

268
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,552
It's number two, right?

269
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,630
It sure is great not having Homer around

270
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:21,672
to tell us where we can or can't park.

271
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,551
Yeah, without the crushing rule of law,

272
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:26,310
society will do a better job
of regulating itself.

273
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:36,229
Of all the nerve!

274
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,620
Now to buy some soft luggage.

275
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,307
Dad? Where are you?

276
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,349
Do not worry. I am working.

277
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:57,866
Working? Where?

278
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:02,116
Ask no questions. And do not call
the police, or I will kill me.

279
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:05,290
- You sound weird.
- All is well. Good-bye forever.

280
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:11,460
- Get out of the way!
- That's my space. - I was here first.

281
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:12,964
NO PARKING SCHOOL ZONE

282
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,966
Avast, ye sky whale!

283
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,379
I need a camera battery!

284
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:42,829
All the Transformers transformed
back into trucks and cars.

285
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:43,946
The end.

286
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:45,690
- Oh, that's great.
- Great story.

287
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,446
Okay, we've got time for one more.

288
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,803
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

289
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:53,245
Once upon a time, there was
a hilarious hogre named Shrek Three.

290
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:54,947
He lived in medieval times,

291
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:58,207
but sometimes he'd say things
from today times...

292
00:18:00,273 --> 00:18:01,404
Got one!

293
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,323
We can say these swears any time
we want because they're in the Bible!

294
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:11,444
I don't think "Leviticus" is a swear.

295
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:13,290
Shut the hell up, you damn ass whore.

296
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,616
- Bart?
- Uh-oh.

297
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:18,102
I'm starting to worry about your father.

298
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:20,416
Well, I know he seems
to get dumber every year,

299
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:21,805
but lately he's plateaued.

300
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:24,345
He hasn't be home in four days.

301
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:27,450
Well, I guess he told me not to worry.

302
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,792
Where are you, Homie?

303
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,629
Yah! Yah, yah, doggies!

304
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,928
Yah! Yah! Yah!

305
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:19,806
Go, go, go!

306
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:41,710
And if elected president
of our small community,

307
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:45,489
I will determine once and for all
how far we can go

308
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:47,284
without being gay.

309
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:52,350
Maggie!

310
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,394
We're free!

311
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:13,516
Maggie! You did all this?!

312
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:18,478
And to pay you back,
I'm returning your nose.

313
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,069
Here's your nose.

314
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,610
Daddy's putting back your nose.

315
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,257
That's your...
Oh, wait. That's Lisa's nose.

316
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:29,356
Homie! You're all right!

317
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:32,466
Thanks to her!

318
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:36,815
Really? Look at you...

319
