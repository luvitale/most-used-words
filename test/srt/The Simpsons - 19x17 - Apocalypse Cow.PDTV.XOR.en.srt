00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:23,518
Hey, hey, kids!

5
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,559
It's a beautiful,
sunny Saturday morning.

6
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,767
So get ready for six hours
of cartoons!

7
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:34,782
Today's Krusty's Korean
Kartoon Kavalcade starts

8
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:39,355
with an exciting adventure
of "The Trans-Clown-O-Morphs."

9
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:44,126
Trans-Clown-O-Morphs
Transforming clowns

10
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:46,350
that morph
Sent to Earth to defeat

11
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,631
the evil Dino-Robo-Bots

12
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,025
Trans-Clown-O-Morphs
Transforming clowns that morph

13
00:01:56,568 --> 00:02:00,634
And their human friend
is you.

14
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:06,624
Back off,
Pterodactyl-bots.

15
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,592
You'll never conquer
Big Top City.

16
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:10,470
Oh, really?

17
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:14,564
It's time to make you
Trans-Clown-O-Morphs extinct.

18
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:19,733
Only my Saturday morning viewers
can save me!

19
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,745
Buy my cereal,
find the secret code inside

20
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:25,265
and text me the message
"start the day with Kellogg's"

21
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,774
- or I will die.
- Enough from you!

22
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,678
Hurry!

23
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,070
Guess no one's buying my cereal.

24
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:35,496
Buy or I'll die.

25
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:38,515
Mom, we need to throw out
all this Krusty cereal

26
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,197
and get Robot Clown cereal!

27
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:42,038
Every week we have
to buy something else

28
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,620
to save that transforming
clown that morphs.

29
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:48,414
I want you to watch a show
that isn't just one long commercial.

30
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,917
Justin Leonard lines up the putt.

31
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,579
This is for par and a share
of sixth place.

32
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:59,674
Mom, we need
a Callaway titanium

33
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:03,038
- perimeter-weighted driver!
- It adds yards to any swing.

34
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:07,238
You two have been bombarded
with enough commercial images.

35
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,659
Lisa, I've got a big bunch
of black banas.

36
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,339
You know what that means.

37
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,021
Bana bread!

38
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:18,337
And Bart, you go with your
father to Shelbyville

39
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:20,438
to get the beanbag chairs
re-beaned.

40
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,852
Oh, no, I hate
the beanbag store.

41
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:25,787
The clerks are always shouting
in Hebrew on their cell phones.

42
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:30,879
So Dean Martin would
show up at the last minute

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,177
and do everything
in just one take?

44
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:35,059
- That's right.
- But Wikipedia said

45
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,741
he was "passionate about rehearsal."

46
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:38,643
Don't you worry about Wikipedia.

47
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:40,589
We'll change it
when we get home.

48
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,128
We'll change a lot of things.

49
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:44,988
Hey, check it out!

50
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,033
I wouldn't mind driving that
over a prairie dog village.

51
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,344
Honk to the driver!

52
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,731
Martin?!

53
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:56,147
What's a tool like you
doing on something cool like that?

54
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,788
Yeah, what's
the deal, loser?

55
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:00,064
I'm operating
a Combine Harvester.

56
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,742
It's part of my duties
as a member of 4-H.

57
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,691
4- H Club? Is it dangerous?

58
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,237
Indeed, it has
the most finger loss

59
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:09,377
of any youth organization.

60
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:11,015
Can I join, Dad?
Can I? Can I? Can I?

61
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:13,452
Son, a lot of these
youth organizations

62
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,287
encourage parents to get
involved in the activities.

63
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,923
- Not this one.
- Sold!

64
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:26,349
"I pledge my head
to clearer thinking,

65
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,125
"my heart to greater loyalty,
my hands.."

66
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:31,209
oh, man, how many
"H's" does this thing have?

67
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,516
Yeah, there's a bunch.

68
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:35,372
Let's skip the oath and, uh,
get you behind the wheel

69
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:36,902
of something you can't handle.

70
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:17,102
Raise articulator,
set hydraulic brakes

71
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:20,068
and endorse farm subsidy check
for crops I didn't grow.

72
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,636
Okay, 4-H-ers,

73
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:38,622
here's your summer project:
pick a calf and raise him up

74
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:41,602
big, strong
and, of course, God-fearing.

75
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:45,744
And at the end of the summer,
the best calf wins a blue ribbon.

76
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,361
I want a tough one.

77
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,076
I didn't come here today
expecting to fall in love.

78
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,981
Hey, it's the runt.

79
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,580
I'll take anything
but the runt.

80
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,395
looks like
we're partners.

81
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:12,532
You're a scrappy little misfit,
just like me.

82
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,729
Anyone want to trade?
No reasonable offer refused.

83
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,487
I'll take a chicken.

84
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:24,966
Pullet, Bantam, Orpington,
Pullet, Flemish Giant,

85
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,296
Pullet, Leghorn...

86
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:28,586
Keep it down!
I'm trying to feed my runt.

87
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:32,822
Here, I'll show you what to do.

88
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:36,990
All right,
I get it, I get it.

89
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:39,170
- By the way, I'm Mary.
- I'm Bart.

90
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:42,666
- This is my calf, Lulubelle.
- Uh, you know that's a boy, right?

91
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,048
Oh, I thought she was
peeing out of her nipple.

92
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:47,648
- How 'bout you just call him "Lou"?
- That's great.

93
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:48,998
It rhymes "moo."

94
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,307
So what do you think of my calf?

95
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,808
Now son, I'm not here to judge.

96
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:21,004
- Actually, yes, you are.
- Eh, what?

97
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,577
Oh, right, I am.

98
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:25,123
Well, I don't know
much about cows,

99
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:27,629
but I think we have a winner!

100
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:32,000
You're the greatest cow
in the world!

101
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,961
I'm going to be
your friend forever.

102
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,514
Bart, you do know
what happens next?

103
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,416
- Something happens next?
- Son, your calf is going

104
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,374
to be taken to a feedlot...

105
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,171
- Lots of feed... that sounds good.
- ... then slaughtered.

106
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:44,984
But he won!

107
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,098
Why don't you kill
the loser cows?

108
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,350
Oh, we will,
but your cow

109
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:51,158
gets to go first.

110
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,564
Mom, they're going to kill Lou
and make him into food and

111
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:02,307
fringe vests for gay cowboys.
Can we buy him back? Can we?

112
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:08,272
honey, we'd love to,
but a prizewinning bull

113
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,767
is thousands of dollars.

114
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:12,211
Oh, man.

115
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:16,485
Son, let this be a lesson:
never work hard and don't form

116
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:20,210
emotional attachments.
Also, don't be a cow.

117
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,359
Lou?

118
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:33,022
Oh, man, now I feel so bad
I'm imaging I hear your voice.

119
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,598
Leave me alone!

120
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,827
It's not my fault there's nothing good to
eat on this planet except meat!

121
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,940
I can't help you!

122
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:45,092
I'm just a little boy!

123
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:48,287
Bart, are you all right?

124
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,384
I hear Lou mooing
in my head.

125
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:52,174
What you heard
was your conscience

126
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,129
telling you to stop
eating meat.

127
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,121
If I could save Lou,
I'd never eat meat again.

128
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,313
Not even prosciutto and melon!

129
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,481
"Anguished Animals III"?

130
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,025
That wasn't my conscience
mooing, it was...

131
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:09,906
Tress MacNeille!

132
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,617
All right,
so I put that there

133
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:15,403
to get you to stop
eating meat.

134
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:18,115
But your body is going
to miss the protein,

135
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:20,243
so you'll have
to take these pills.

136
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:24,307
Sorry, Lis.
I can't be a vegetarian.

137
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:25,912
I love the taste of death.

138
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:28,381
But please, help me
get my cow back.

139
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,307
Okay, meet me halfway.

140
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:33,003
Stop stirring your lemonade
with a sausage.

141
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,140
- Give me a minute.
- Come on.

142
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:38,782
It's a no-brainer.

143
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:49,340
Aw, man, I never figured
the gate would be locked.

144
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:50,920
It's like they knew
we were coming.

145
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:52,779
Don't worry; I called
some animal activists

146
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,533
who can help us get in.
I'll just give the signal.

147
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:57,604
Milk is murder.

148
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:00,111
Cheese is genocide.

149
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:03,603
- Good to see you, Windsong.
- Windsong?

150
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:07,040
Yeah, it's my code name. This is
Compost and this is Solar Panel.

151
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,555
What's my code name?

152
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,250
Lisa's Brother.

153
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,994
Forgive us for this violation,
Mother Fence.

154
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:23,297
We honor
your chain-link spirit.

155
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,729
Lou.

156
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,744
Lou.

157
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,804
Lou, where are you,
little buddy?

158
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:43,961
Lou, what happened to you?
You got fat.

159
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,314
Of course he did.

160
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,925
His food is laced
with growth hormones.

161
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,448
I don't care how much
of a pumped-up freak you are.

162
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:56,026
I still love you.

163
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:58,623
The way Barry Bonds' kids
probably still love him.

164
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,581
Come on. Come on.

165
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,907
How we going to get
him out of here?

166
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:17,501
Wow, you did learn a lot
at 4-H.

167
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:18,994
Hell, yeah.

168
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:24,284
That was a
practice cow.

169
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:36,171
What are we going
to do with him?

170
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,596
Well, your friend Mary
from 4-H lives on a farm.

171
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:40,268
Lou can stay with her.

172
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,272
a cow on a farm.

173
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:44,479
With a moo-moo here
and a moo-moo there...

174
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,931
Yes, it works.

175
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,574
All right, Lou,
to freedom!

176
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:49,700
Lou?

177
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:04,976
Howdy, what's yours
that mine's is Cletus?

178
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,605
He wants to know
your name.

179
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:09,679
Oh, I'm Bart Simpson.
Is Mary here?

180
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,172
Hang on. Hey, Mary, there's a
boy here askin' on you!

181
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,139
Hey, Bart.

182
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,851
I didn't know
Cletus was your dad.

183
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:21,045
She had a regular city birth
in a gas station.

184
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:23,395
The feedlot wants to kill Lou
and I can't keep him.

185
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:24,680
Can I give him to you?

186
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:30,710
Brandine, a young feller
just offered Mary a cow!

187
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,807
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

188
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:34,069
What's going on?

189
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,199
According to the traditions
of the hill folk,

190
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,806
by giving our
daughter a cow,

191
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:40,123
you've made a formal
proposal of marriage.

192
00:13:42,277 --> 00:13:44,686
This calls for a hoedown.

193
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,055
Blow her a song of love.

194
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:54,175
I said love, not lust.

195
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,514
I can't get married. I'm only ten.

196
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:00,731
And I have dreams.
I got 1580 on my DQAT.

197
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:03,547
- DQAT?
- Dairy Queen Aptitude Test.

198
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:06,038
800 ice cream,
780 Brazier.

199
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,401
Bart, I'll find a way to
get you out of this wedding.

200
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:11,911
In the meantime, just say yes,
so Lou will be safe.

201
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:13,716
Look how happy he is.

202
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:19,429
I wished I had a tail
what did swap away flies.

203
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,406
Mine just hangs there.

204
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:24,886
All right, sir,
I'll marry your daughter.

205
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:28,204
We're gonna have us
the fanciest wedding in the county.

206
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:31,126
Cletus, open up a wall
so Dia-Betty can come.

207
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:34,423
Oh, just bring 'em to a window,
so I can pinch 'em.

208
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:37,420
We always figured
someday Mary would marry.

209
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:39,585
That's why we called her Mary.

210
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:43,141
We name all our kids after what
we think's gonna happen to 'em.

211
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:45,271
Ain't that right,
Stabbed-in-jail?

212
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:47,390
We'll see who stabs who.

213
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:53,372
Strained spinach?
I'm not going to eat that.

214
00:14:53,373 --> 00:14:55,271
It's yucky.

215
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,409
Yo, I'm the coolest puppet
in Sockville,

216
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,605
and I love
strained spinach.

217
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:05,358
Really? I  guess I'll
try it then.

218
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:12,192
I wonder
if Maggie would like it.

219
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:17,703
Mom, Dad! Bart's marrying
one of Cletus' daughters.

220
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,405
We're putting a stop
to this right now.

221
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:23,877
Wait. If you stop the wedding,
Bart's cow will die,

222
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:25,635
and he really cares
about that cow

223
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:28,599
and Bart doesn't usually care
about stuff, so help.

224
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,419
all right,
I've got an idea,

225
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,207
- but it'll take a lot of sewing.
- I'll get your fabrics.

226
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,925
And I'll make sure
Flanders doesn't bother us.

227
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:40,086
What was that for?

228
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,694
Bart's in trouble and we don't
need your stupid comments.

229
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:44,058
Zippin' it up.

230
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,475
Okay, let's set up the
chitlin bar over here.

231
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,747
Uh, start drizzling the crawdad
reduction on the possum pouches.

232
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:10,310
And excuse me, why are the spittoons
so far from the chaw station?

233
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:12,648
This is a wedding, people,
not a funeral.

234
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,985
Here you go,
sweetheart.

235
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:20,578
Something old...

236
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:26,112
... something new,
something burrowed,

237
00:16:26,113 --> 00:16:28,028
and something stew.

238
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,019
Mama, you know I love
your somethin' stew,

239
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,296
but I got no appetite
for any of this.

240
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:34,612
you just got cold feet...

241
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:37,312
'cause you're barefoot
and our floor's made of mud.

242
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:40,548
Have you seen my sister?

243
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,725
No, and she's cutting
it pretty close.

244
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:45,485
We're about ten minutes away
from "You may kiss the bride."

245
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:47,826
Kiss?! I thought we were
just getting married.

246
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:53,051
Do you, Bart Simpson,
take Mary Wrestlemania Spuckler

247
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:55,106
to be your lawful
wedded wife

248
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:57,642
for as long as you
both shall reckon?

249
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:02,211
I do.

250
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:05,014
And since we don't need
to hear from women folk

251
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:07,821
what they think,
I now pronounce you...

252
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:09,643
Stop the wedding!

253
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,946
Bart is a ten-year-old boy.

254
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:16,454
He still sits in the driveway
and pretends to drive the car.

255
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,685
Mom, I have to do this.

256
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:23,579
- I love that big ol' cow.
- How could you say that?

257
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,719
I starved myself to
get into this dress.

258
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,421
No, no, no, no, no,
you look great, honey.

259
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,892
Mom, if I don't get married,
they'll take Lou.

260
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:33,331
I'm sorry, Bart,
but sometimes

261
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:35,438
your mom knows best.

262
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,509
Son, I'm afraid
hillbilly law is clear.

263
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,602
If this marriage is off,
then that cow is going

264
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,305
back to the feedlot,
and Mary must taste

265
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:47,858
the bitter agony
of being an old maid of 11.

266
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,546
Don't feel
bad, sweetie.

267
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:51,869
I was 13 when I
married your father.

268
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,235
Yeah, and you'd already
been divorced four times.

269
00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:00,068
Good-bye, Lou.

270
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:01,904
I'll never forget you.

271
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:07,142
Mom, how could
you do this to me?

272
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:10,165
Sweetie, don't you think your mom
might have a trick up her sleeve?

273
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,269
No.

274
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,283
- Trust me.
- D'oh! I mean, moo!

275
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,932
Okay, they bought it.

276
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,534
- Have you got Lou in your car?
- Roger that.

277
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:26,363
You guys come and get me as soon
as they dump me in the feedlot.

278
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:35,977
Ooh, "Laughter House."
With the world

279
00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:39,252
in the shape it's in,
we could all use some comedy.

280
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,812
Okay, have fun at
the Laughter House.

281
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,927
Now I'll just turn off my
phone to save the battery.

282
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,281
Great plan, Mom.

283
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:58,942
But where is Lou
going to go?

284
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:01,137
Don't worry, Bart.

285
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,585
In India, your cow
will be treated like a god

286
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,883
and receive the food
and medical care

287
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:08,271
that in America would go
to human beings.

288
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:13,634
Lou,
if that plane leaves the ground

289
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,609
and you're not on it,
you'll regret it.

290
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,982
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but soon,

291
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,542
and definitely
after they kill you

292
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,837
and make you into sloppy joes.

293
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,434
Here's looking at you, cud.

294
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:45,916
Okay, Lisa, I'm turning
my phone back on

295
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,667
to see if your father
is ready to be picked up.

296
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:52,222
I have over 400 text messages.

297
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:55,125
Ready... for... pickup.

298
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:58,204
Ready... for... pickup.

299
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,269
I'm a human being! Let me go!

300
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,928
You are now entering the killing floor.

301
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:15,637
that sounds
like Tress MacNeille.

302
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:32,040
Marge, kids,
the things I saw.

303
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:35,140
It makes me never want
to eat meat again.

304
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:40,199
Just fish, chicken, burgers, veal on
Fridays, deer, but only in season

305
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,867
and if necessary, the
sweetest meat of all: human.

306
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,464
For you, Dad,
I consider that a victory.

307
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,112
You're in a better place now, Lou,

308
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:53,391
and I'll always be proud
that for once in my life,

309
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:55,433
I had a cow, man.

310
00:20:56,531 --> 00:21:06,953
