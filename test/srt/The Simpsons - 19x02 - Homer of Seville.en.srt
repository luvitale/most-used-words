5
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,282
Did you bring the milk?

6
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,001
TODAY'S TOPIC: JESUS:
THE REAL AMERICAN IDOL

7
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:10,118
This concludes our service.

8
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:12,377
Go now in the peace of the Lord.

9
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:15,193
So long, suckers!
Move it, move it, move it!

10
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:17,967
Do you want to be second
out of the parking lot? Do you?

11
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,536
- Leave her!
- We left her last week,

12
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:22,791
and she didn't make it home for dinner!

13
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,657
You'll never catch me, Lord!

14
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:31,152
Oh, man, that church
service was so boring.

15
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,666
I did a whole book of Find-A-Words.

16
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:37,131
Dad, all you circled were
the "I"s and "A"s.

17
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:38,226
Those are words.

18
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:39,840
Well, where should we go for brunch?

19
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:41,225
Griddler on the Roof?

20
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:43,503
Thank God It's Fried Eggs?

21
00:02:43,612 --> 00:02:44,815
Luftwaffle's?

22
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,347
Bodacious Frittatas?

23
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,920
Buffet the Hunger Slayer?

24
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:50,249
I want to say one. Be my guest.

25
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:51,697
Denny's.

26
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,648
Every place has such a long line.

27
00:02:54,747 --> 00:02:57,715
Don't worry. We'll just go home.
Your mother can cook.

28
00:02:57,853 --> 00:02:59,403
I just want a simple salad

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,155
with pine nuts, haricots verts,
seasonal heirloom tomatoes...

30
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:04,890
Forget it! One day a week,

31
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,787
I should be able to put on nice clothes

32
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,997
and have someone bring food tome.

33
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,307
There's a place... with no line!

34
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:14,710
STARVING TEACHERS CATERING

35
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,597
Bart, that's not a restaurant,
it's somebody's house.

36
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:20,904
Lisa's right, son. Your mom
is way too classy a lady

37
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,484
- to crash a private...
- I'm not cooking!

38
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,997
And you can cut your own meat!

39
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,963
Everyone just act cool.

40
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,062
If anyone asks, tell
them we're plumbers,

41
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,158
and then start plumbing
until they go away.

42
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,808
Hi... you!

43
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:42,976
Dude! You don't think,
you know me, but you do!

44
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:48,616
Oh Homer, you've got to try
this roast beef au jus.

45
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:51,904
Mmm! Au jus!

46
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:54,584
Not quite gravy, not quite blood.

47
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:56,316
Look at the crowd around that table.

48
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,195
It must be a make your own sundae bar!

49
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:02,723
Oh, I can't wait to
taste that hot fudge,

50
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:06,889
and caramel and crushed nuts
all slathered over a delicious...

51
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,341
elderly corpse?!

52
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:10,805
We crashed a funeral!

53
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,645
Oh, my God! Quick, everyone,
put on their long faces.

54
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:17,129
Longer!

55
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:24,551
We should get out of here. Come on!

56
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:27,674
Where's Bart?

57
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:30,742
Mahogany. Great movie, great casket.

58
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,693
I miss my Pop-pop.

59
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:35,094
I miss him, too. What's your name?

60
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,436
Donny. You're Donny?

61
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,097
Pop-pop said that after he died,

62
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:42,517
you should give me ten bucks a week.

63
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,605
Starting now.

64
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:47,380
- Okay.
- Um, listen,

65
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:50,375
I'm out of town next week, so...

66
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:53,939
Come on, we're leaving!
Ooh. After one more mini-quiche.

67
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,874
Excuse me.

68
00:04:57,994 --> 00:05:00,795
My brother twisted his ankle
setting up the chairs.

69
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,135
Will the tragedies that stalk
this family never cease?

70
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,227
- Would you like to be a pallbearer?
- Of course.

71
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,522
I thought she said polar bear.

72
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,831
Please, sir, a little
respect for the dead.

73
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:18,078
Oh, yes, of course.

74
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,594
Oh, my back!

75
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:24,471
It hurts, and not in a good way.

76
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,688
Well, time to move on with our lives.

77
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,521
Oh, stop it!

78
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:34,405
I'm down here.

79
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,789
Homer, you have a mild back sprain.

80
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:41,096
And you also ingested
a dangerous quantity of grave dirt.

81
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:44,028
Well, you're always telling me
I should eat more dirt.

82
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:46,361
Not dirt. Vegetables!

83
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,602
Which grow in what?

84
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:52,800
Oh! Look, I just need to make sure
your vertebrae are properly aligned.

85
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,341
This should take only a minute,
and cost about a thousand dollars.

86
00:05:57,317 --> 00:06:00,209
That doesn't sound like
Homer's usual annoyed grunt.

87
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,590
Fascinating.

88
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,773
When Homer's on his back,

89
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:09,206
his stomach lodges perfectly
under his diaphragm,

90
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,123
giving him a powerful singing voice.

91
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:13,419
- Is that a real thing?
- It is!

92
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,256
Tenor Andrea Bocelli recorded
an entire song on his back.

93
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,132
You know, Homer, your singing
could help alleviate patient suffering,

94
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,914
and save us a fortune in Demerol.

95
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,353
My pleasure.

114

a case of Adam's apples,
that motorcycle man's moustache.

115
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:35,342
Oh, the money you've contributed to anti
helmet laws has really paid off, sir.

116
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,555

It's making my heart race!

120
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:52,156
It's coming from down the hall.

121
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,843

artistic director,

00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:28,889
But I can only sing lying on my back.

Oh, oh, I just have one question:
what is this movie about?

135
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:44,482
For the last time, it's not a movie!

136

Excuse me, "film."

137

An opera star!

149
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:54,956
Dad, you were great!

150
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,267
And you contributed to our culture!

151
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,185
- Well, I didn't mean to.
- No, no. It's a good thing.

Oh, good. This makes up for me

showing up drunk
to the father-daughter dance.

Nice set, Homer. That was a hot one.

162
00:10:56,221 --> 00:11:00,013
Wow, praise from Placido Domingo.

163
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:01,945
Just call me P-Dingo,

164
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:04,586
Eh, I'll think about it.

165
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:09,092
You know, Homer, there's one thing
about opera that has always bugged me:

166
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:11,483
everyone sings instead of talking.

167
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:18,282
But you made me believe I was in a
magical world where singing is talking.

168
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:22,518
Thanks! You know, of the three
tenors, you're my second favorite!

169
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:25,890
No wait, I forgot about that other guy.
Sorry, you're third.

170
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,037
Wait, Homer, before you go,

171
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,187
there is a new note I've been
working on. Tell me what you think...

172
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:46,813
what if you gave it a little
more of this flavor:

173
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,223
Like this?

174
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:56,154
Keep reaching for the stars, kid.

175
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:03,106
Happy anniversary, sweetie.

176
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:07,438
You know, it might be a little more
romantic without your entourage.

177
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:10,348
But I need my childhood friends
to help me keep it real.

178
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:11,880
Would you have me keep it fake?

179
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:16,139
Homer, can't we please be alone?
It's our anniversary.

180
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,779
We'll move to another table.

181
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:20,726
Yoko.

182
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:21,924
See?

183
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:25,219
- Isn't it nicer, with just you and...
- Excuse us.

184
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,670
Would you mind signing
autographs for my mother and me?

185
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:34,204
Oh, my pleasure.
To the hottest girls in the room.

186
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,125
What is he saying?

187
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:40,319
I said you look hot! Hot! Ay Chihuahua!

188
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:43,278
- Ay chi-what?
- Hua-hua!

189
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:45,804
I want you to stop flirting with women.

190
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:46,938
No problem.

191
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,766
Sir, may I say I thoroughly
enjoyed your performance.

192
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:55,830
May I say I'm enjoying the calm
waters of your deep, blue eyes?

193
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,624
Oh, well...

194
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,712
What? That's how guys talk.

195
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:06,837
You are out of control! The late nights,
the eating!

196
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:09,586
You've actually outgrown your cape!

197
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:16,162
Oh, Homie...
I miss our alone time. I miss you.

198
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:22,076
- Need some help, H?
- Want us to take Marge shopping?

199
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,962
You guys go on, we're gonna walk home.

200
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,200
Great call, H, walking's the best.

201
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,059
I really want to hook up with Homer.

202
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:35,802
Now we both know that ain't
gonna happen, but, uh, I'm right here.

203
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,801
Marge, when I'm onstage,

204
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:53,246
I can only sing those love songs
by picturing your beautiful face.

205
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:58,199
So in a way, my groupies
are really ourgroupies.

206
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,146
- Aw, you're sweet.
- Oh, my God, it's him!

207
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:12,827
Use your opera glasses, Dorothy.

208
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,733
Switching to thermal imaging.

209
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:22,778
Target acquired.

210
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:33,075
Oh, we're trapped.
Your fans will rip us to pieces.

211
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,696
Not me, they love me.

212
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,119
Get on.

213
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:57,636
Sir, thank you for saving us.
Do you want to come in for coffee?

214
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,325
That's right, I'm a woman.

215
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,455
A lady motorcycle driver?!
What is this,The Twilight Zone?

216
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:11,176
It's a shame a few out of control fans
can make the rest of us look bad.

217
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:13,659
I couldn't agree more, Julia.

218
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:17,539
Listen, I love opera, but I hate the way
these people treat your husband.

219
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:19,751
Why don't you make me
president of Homer's fan club

220
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,621
and I'll keep the crazies in check.

221
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,167
That's a great idea. To celebrate,
I'll go whip us up some Chex Mix pie.

222
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,505
So did you see the show tonight?

223
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,357
Remember the part where I forgot
the words and I just sang:

224
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,972
"Uh-oh Spaghetti-os"?

225
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:35,535
I'm hoping they send me a case.

226
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,652
Now listen, Homer.
You can have me anytime you want me.

227
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,196
Marge!

228
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:46,960
But if you say one word to your wife,
I'll tell her you attacked me.

229
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:48,584
What is it, sweetie?

230
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:52,488
Um... everyone's wearing
clothes in here.

231
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:53,999
That's nice.

232
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:58,746
if you send him Mr. Simpson will send
you a photo a self-addressed envelope.

233
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:01,841
Mr. Simpson cannot sing at
your daughter's birthday,

234
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:03,765
but he will come for cake.

235
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:06,690
Dedicate your shopping center?
What's the anchor store?

236
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:09,568
- I don't think so.
- She's perfect!

237
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:14,037
For the first time since you became
an opera star I can finally relax.

238
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,860
Well, uh, I'm not sure
she's working out.

239
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:44,024
That's it!
Let me make something very clear:

240
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,039
my heart belongs to Marge
and you can never, ever have it.

241
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:50,560
This opera's over when the fatmansings.

242
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:55,148
All right, Homer. I understand
perfectly. You shall never be mine.

243
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:58,456
That's good. You've calmly accepted
that you will never have

244
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:02,377
the only man you could ever love. Now,
I think it would be best if you left.

245
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,468
- Julia, wait!
- Yes?

246
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:09,721
Before you go,
could you hire your own replacement?

247
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,649
But make sure she's not crazy like you.

248
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,013
Die, you stupid cobra! Die! Die!

249
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:27,696
Dad, I think someone's
trying to kill you.

250
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:30,401
Who could it be?
A disgruntled former employee?

251
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:33,668
Whoever it is, the cobra
is their symbol.

252

258
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:59,509
Chief, I think we should
cancel the performance.

259
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:02,828
No can do, Marge.My first duty
is to the season-ticket holders.

260
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:06,571
But don't worry,I've got the entire
opera house on a complete lockdown.

261
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:11,094
I got sharpshooters on the gargoyles,
inflatable Homer decoys in the seats,

262
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,547
and to take out the biggest threat of
all, we're pre-crashing the chandelier.

263
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:31,895
o/~ Se il mio nome saper voi bramate
Dal mio labbro il mio nome...o/~

264
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,127
I'm so tense.

265
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:39,034
I can't enjoy Count Almaviva serenading
the intended brideof Dr. Bartalo.

266
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,388
I just can't.

267
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,385
I don't see anything suspicious.

268
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:45,891
Except someone is loudly
unwrapping their candy.

269
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:49,004
It ain't candy, it's a lamb
chop wrapped in foil.

270
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,404
Hey, Mom, do all conductors carry
poisoned blow-dartsin their pocket?

271
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,975
Well, Arthur Fiedler used to,
but I'd better take a look.

272
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:05,675
Chief Wiggums!
The maestro is the killer!

273
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,570
All right, I'm going in.

274
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:19,464
Allegro! Allegro!
I mean, andante. Andante! Ah, yeah.

275
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,800
Snipers, take the shot.

276
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:51,223
Okay, that's a wrap, people!

277
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,687
Luckily, the sniper
bullets stopped her heart

278
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,588
from pumping the poison through her body

279
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,658
long enough for the chandelier
to squish it all out of her.

280
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,133
With any luck, she'll be up
and stalking within a week.

281
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:08,887
I'm sorry you got hurt,
but you learned an important lesson.

282
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:11,587
One comes between me and my Homie.

283
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:15,702
I'll get you for this, Marge,
if it's the last thing I do.

284
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,547
Oh, and I scheduled
the cable guy to come

285
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:19,308
on Wednesday between 10:00 and 2:00.

286
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:23,568
- Oh, but Wednesday's not good for me.
- I know, Marge. I know.

287
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:34,593
Let's go, Hagliacci,
or should I say, Madame Butterface?

288
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:36,073
What? What? I had two.

289
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,577
Well, that's it.
I'm retiring from the opera.

290
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,978
It's just too popular.
And I know something

291
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,978
much more fun I can do on my back.

292
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:52,956
Singing opera made me good at painting.

293
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:55,326
- Is that a real thing?
- No.
