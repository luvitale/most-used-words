00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,794
Why do we have to
get here so early?

5
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:34,780
The football game
doesn't start for hours.

6
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:37,724
We're not here for the game.

7
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:40,049
The game is nothing.
The game is crap.

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,617
The game makes me sick!

9
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:44,378
The real reason we Americans
put up with sports is for this:

10
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:49,607
Behold the tailgate party,
the pinnacle of human achievement!

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,204
Since the dawn of parking lots,
man has sought to stuff his guts

12
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:57,193
with food and alcohol in anticipation
of watching others exercise.

13
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,728
What child birth is to women,
eating trunk meats

14
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,503
is to the bewanged.

15
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:09,345
What could be greater than
eating and drinking for hours

16
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:11,336
in a drizzly parking lot?

17
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,715
- Anything.
- No. Everything is better.

18
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:15,111
- Anything!
- Everything!

19
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:16,554
- Anything!
- Everything!

20
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:17,892
- Anything!
- Everything!

21
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:19,113
- Anything!
- Everything!

22
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:20,230
- Anything!
- Everything!

23
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:22,435
Daddy, I made
a Ralphwich!

24
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:25,478
It tastes hurty!

25
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,203
That's 'cause its' not food, ralphy.

26
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:31,547
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
It's food. It's food.

27
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:33,560
Everything's
what you say it is.

28
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,269
All right.

29
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,096
Time to dig in.
I brought everything we need.

30
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:42,021
It's just forks and plates.

31
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:45,124
- Didn't we bring any food?
- The food is all around us!

32
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,896
You brought us here to beg?

33
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:51,354
When you know the people
you're begging from, it's mooching.

34
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:56,588
Moleman! Come here,
ya big bag o' skin!

35
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,734
How the hell are ya, huh?

36
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:02,829
No kidding!

37
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,954
Well, that sounds like
you're going to have fun.

38
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:10,773
Springfield U sucks!

39
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:13,953
A&M cheerleaders are clumsy!

40
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:17,886
Your superstar professors treat
undergrads like an afterthought!

41
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,438
Your tenure track
is heavily politicized!

42
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,807
Oh, that's it!

43
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:27,291
Lisa, honey, just
because you're a girl

44
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:29,280
doesn't mean you can't
join in the fun.

45
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,124
Maggie and I are washing
the soiled foam fingers.

46
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:38,086
Well, I guess I could cut loose
and do a little homework.

47
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:40,865
I can start working
on my school video project.

48
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:44,232
The assignment is to film
the beauty of the everyday.

49
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,493
So let's see.

50
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,397
There's drama and inspiration
everywhere I look.

51
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:18,630
I am a born film maker!

52
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,026
Really
interesting stuff.

53
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:29,138
Three points out
of a possible five.

54
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,468
Ah, that's a funny joke,
Mr. Kincaid.

55
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:35,194
Is this an art class
or a comedy class?

56
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,916
- I can make it a two.
- Three it is!

57
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:41,901
You're the teacher,
and I accept your decision.

58
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,911
The man is an idiot!

59
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:47,187
Agreed. The film has everything:
emotion, conflict, Milhouse.

60
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,721
Lisa, you're a gifted film maker.

61
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,637
It's as if Ingmar Bergman
and Penny Marshall had a baby.

62
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:55,877
Principal Skinner, I didn't know
you knew so much about film.

63
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,896
Cinema is my secret passion.

64
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:02,683
I've even written a screenplay
or two on speculation.

65
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:05,633
When Edna Met Seymour,
Ghost Willie,

66
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,852
Killing Seymour's Mother,
The Principal Who Sold a Screenplay.

67
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:11,636
They sound great.
I'd love to read them sometime.

68
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:13,885
Unfortunately, the studios
have made it clear

69
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,811
they're not interested
in my work.

70
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:19,177
In fact, I'm... I'm no longer welcome
on the Universal Studios tour.

71
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,133
Orlando or Hollywood?

72
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:22,777
There's one in Hollywood?!

73
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:25,568
- Yeah, getting back to my grade
- Forget grades!

74
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,932
With the right subject,
you could be a great filmmaker.

75
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,728
What comes to mind
when you think of drama?

76
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,647
Well, according to Aristotle,
drama contains six elements:

77
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:38,109
- plot, theme, character...
- Not the smarty-pants answer.

78
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,968
Where's the drama in your life?

79
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:42,358
Okay, but can I just finish
the smarty-pants answer?

80
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,568
- No! In your life!
- My family!

81
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,367
Language, rhythm
and spectacle.

82
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,454
Family, eh? That's right!

83
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:51,654
Your brother is Bart Simpson,
one of Mrs. Krabappel's

84
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:55,053
fourth graders, and your father is
a local character of note.

85
00:04:56,965 --> 00:05:00,825
Lisa, if you make a documentary
about your family, I can help you.

86
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,009
I'm giving you the key
to the AV cage.

87
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:10,888
This is so generous.

88
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,765
How can I ever repay you?

89
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:15,760
All I ask is,
if you ever win an Oscar...

90
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,134
give it to me.

91
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:18,760
Um, okay.

92
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,806
Those cabinetmakers laughed at me,
but they'll see.

93
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,754
Lisa, what are you doing?

94
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:31,950
I'm making a documentary
about a very special family.

95
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,107
- Smithers and Burns?
- No. Us!

96
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,804
- Can I be Smithers?
- No, Dad,

97
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,796
I want you to play
Homer Simpson.

98
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,611
Why, 'cause I'm fat?

99
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:42,147
I love documentaries!

100
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,712
Especially the one
that came with our lawnmower.

101
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,304
Although it was suspiciously
pro-lawnmower.

102
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:50,334
Okay, everyone,
just be yourself.

103
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,804
Don't look in the camera.
Pretend I'm not here and...

104
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,247
no toupees.

105
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:57,630
What, I'm going
for a Shia LaBeouf thing.

106
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,716
Not quite a nerd,
not quite a hunk...

107
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,144
Shia LaBeouf!

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,391
And let's roll.

109
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:07,660
Uh-oh, there's already
an on-set romance.

110
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:13,105
Homie, she's not
making a snuggle film.

111
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,292
Ew, Lisa,
make them stop!

112
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:19,959
I'm sorry, but as a filmmaker,
I have to face the truth.

113
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:22,561
I turn my camera on

114
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:26,071
I cut my fingers on the way

115
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:28,016
On the way

116
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:30,317
The way I'm slipping away

117
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:32,182
I turn my turn my feelings off

118
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,130
You made me untouchable for life

119
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,128
And you wasn't polite

120
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:45,081
It hit me like a tom

121
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,902
You hit me like a tom

122
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:54,635
No-no, no

123
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,743
- Skinner!
- Yes, Superintendent Chalmers?

124
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:08,287
I hear you've been encouraging
a student's creativity!

125
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:10,796
- Please, sir, I can explain...
- I'm thrilled!

126
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:13,810
Or would have been, if not
for your knee-jerk assumption

127
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:16,525
that I'm angry at you,
which I am now.

128
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:19,223
Anyway, we have got
to support Lisa Simpson's film.

129
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,154
This is our chance to finally show up

130
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:24,067
that fancy Springfield Creative
Arts Academy.

131
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,960
The whole school
is made up of modeling clay.

132
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,971
Every afternoon, they reshape it
just to get my goat.

133
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:38,788
Well, with some school band

134
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,990
music and added effects, we could
show Lisa's film at the public library.

135
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,081
Think bigger, Seymour.

136
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:45,997
Think film festivals.

137
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,213
You mean...

138
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,370
Banff?

139
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:51,677
Banff, Shmanff.
I'm talking about Sundance!

140
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:52,886
Sundance?!

141
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:55,584
The preeminent
independent film festival

142
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,325
held each January
in Park City, Utah?

143
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:00,251
Yes, the very same, yes.

144
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:03,292
If Lisa's movie gets in,
we won't just be the school

145
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:05,828
with the highest
hamster mortality rate.

146
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,151
Ah, so young.

147
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,405
We'll also have a kid
who did a thing.

148
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:15,298
I call this cue
"Homer's Lament."

149
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:25,866
What are you boys
doing on the Foley stage?

150
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:28,627
Awesome-ing up
your sound effects.

151
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,407
Okay, one more take.

152
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:33,711
Can we please
go to the next scene?

153
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,363
Oh, dear.

154
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,408
We're getting too many
mainstream movies.

155
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,192
When are we going
to see a submission

156
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:44,455
with the Sundance
independent film spirit?

157
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:46,226
"Paul Giamatti...

158
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,815
"is the world's
greatest superspy...

159
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:52,192
"who only exists
"in the mind

160
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:55,704
of an overweight agoraphobic
"jazz musician...

161
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,963
played by Martin Lawrence
in a fat suit."

162
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:06,977
Oh, okay, here's one
from Springfield,

163
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,532
made by a vegetarian...

164
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,719
intellectual misfit...

165
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:14,762
People, you know you have
to limit your gasps at this altitude.

166
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:17,105
Oh, and she's eight years old!

167
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,392
Stupid charities.

168
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:34,520
They think I'm going
to give them money?

169
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,241
Save the Children?
Save your breath.

170
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,048
Take a hike, Sierra Club.

171
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,498
Doctors without Borders?

172
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,104
Doctors without money!

173
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,902
Hey, Greenpeace, you're
not getting a piece of my green.

174
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,676
Robert Redford? Guess what.

175
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:48,845
A scissor runs through it.

176
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:50,837
Dad, no!

177
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,195
My movie got in!

178
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,965
I'm going
to the Sundance Film Festival!

179
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,311
Film festival, eh?

180
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,665
Aye, los DVDs!

181
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,369
With director's commentary
and deleted scenes!

182
00:10:15,684 --> 00:10:17,281
Where'd everybody go?

183
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,736
I can't believe I'm a director
with a movie at Sundance.

184
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:34,921
Maybe I can finally
meet Jim Jarmusch

185
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,689
and ask him who he is.

186
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,091
Hey, that's him.

187
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:39,969
Who are you?

188
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,384
I try to answer that
question in my films.

189
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:43,543
What else?

190
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:45,854
I can eat a raw onion
without crying.

191
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,338
Prove it, Hollywood.

192
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,801
Hey, you're crying.

193
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,183
Yeah, but I'm crying
about something else.

194
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:56,087
What?

195
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,960
This is the last time
we'll ever be together.

196
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,997
These badges will get us into any
of the independent movies

197
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,471
playing at Sundance.

198
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,379
Ooh, Regularsville.

199
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,315
Sounds like my kind of place.

200
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:17,007
Oh, Candyland.

201
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:20,944
A great family game
is now a great family movie.

202
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:28,045
I get it.

203
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:31,427
Every title means the
opposite of what it means.

204
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:35,281
Then I bet I'll love
Chernobyl Graveyard.

205
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,990
I didn't.

206
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:44,372
This is it: my premiere.

207
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,883
We can't wait to see it, sweetie.

208
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:49,244
Oh, a documentary?

209
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:52,932
Passes, please.

210
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:54,236
Uh, we're with them.

211
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,229
You know these guys?

212
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,596
I've never seen them before.

213
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,154
Uh... we, uh...

214
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:03,086
He's...

215
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:04,190
He's, uh,

216
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,050
he's, uh...

217
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:06,196
That's a joke.

218
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,436
This can't be real.

219
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:18,731
It isn't. You crashed and now you're
lying unconscious in a snowbank.

220
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,605
Chalmskinn.

221
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,494
I'm Lisa Simpson,
and this is my family.

222
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,523
One, two, three.

223
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,751
Another chute?!

224
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:43,135
Why... doesn't... life...

225
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,112
give me... ladders?!

226
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:48,477
We never get more than
one move into this game.

227
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,920
What a wonderful film
about horrible people.

228
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:54,565
They're like the family from
hell on acid that's on steroids.

229
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:01,455
You stupid kid!

230
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,633
What if I walked
in here barefoot?

231
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:05,129
You did, Dad.

232
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:13,251
Happy birthday, Mom.

233
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:15,118
Thank you, dear.

234
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:19,543
Brava, Lisa!

235
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:20,832
Shame on Marge!

236
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,494
Death to Maggie!

237
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,891
Lisa, how could you?

238
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,403
I didn't mean it like that.

239
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:30,295
A lot of things got changed
in the editing room.

240
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:33,367
Proudly edited by Lisa Simpson.

241
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:41,368
Lisa, your movie exposed
our crappy side to the world.

242
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:45,719
I knew you were lame, but
I never imagined you were bogus.

243
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:50,943
Sweetie, I'm usually your #1 fan,
but... call me old-fashioned...

244
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:54,080
I usually don't like movies
that humiliate my family

245
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:55,545
in front of the world.

246
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:58,112
Oh... I was just trying
to accurately portray

247
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,767
my unique and quirky home life.

248
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:04,457
Quirky? Quirky is a grandma
who gives people the finger.

249
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,877
You made us look
like monsters.

250
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:07,944
Monsters!

251
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,162
Monsters!

252
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,547
Monsters!

253
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:14,047
Guys, guys, look,
it's a documentary.

254
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:17,580
Nobody outside of this festival
is ever going to hear about it.

255
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:21,279
"Lisa Simpson's unflinching,
darkly comic family portrait

256
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,415
"is the can't-miss hit
of the festival.

257
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,872
"Landspeeder, do not Bantha,
to your nearest cinema

258
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:30,558
"to see Lisa Simpson stab her family
in the back with her camera."

259
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,445
Don't you dare
post that review.

260
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,027
I'm sorry. You're too late.

261
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:37,079
I have just hit "enter," sending
the wi-fi beams along their way.

262
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,154
Not if I can help it.
Come here, beams, come on.

263
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:40,640
Hey, hey, where
you going? Come...

264
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:42,063
Oh, there's too many.

265
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,895
I just said
I was thinking of adopting

266
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:50,102
Scarlett Johansson. I mean, is
that so wrong?

267
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,834
Well, if we can't get into Sundance,
would you like to check out

268
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:55,075
its alternative cousin Slamdance?

269
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:56,286
I'd rather die.

270
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,108
There they are: the producers

271
00:14:58,109 --> 00:14:59,667
of Capturing the Simpsons.

272
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:00,921
Your movie's great.

273
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:03,355
We want to be
in the Chalmskinn business.

274
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:05,409
This is it, Seymour,
the big deal.

275
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,900
Just play it cool.

276
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,363
Look, we want
to buy this movie

277
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:10,211
and we're prepared
to offer you anything.

278
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:11,804
We're prepared
to accept anything.

279
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:13,619
Name your price.

280
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,990
We want ten percent
of the first-dollar gross,

281
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,001
full European
distribution rights,

282
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:21,758
and access to the most exclusive
VIP tent in Sundance.

283
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:27,336
Way to make a
deal, Seymour.

284
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:29,875
They don't even know
that my pockets are full

285
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,771
of bottled water and cornbread.

286
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:33,649
Yes.

287
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:43,380
- It's them.
- Look at them walking around.

288
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:45,197
Ugh, they're so creepy.

289
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:47,401
Say something
dysfunctional!

290
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:49,504
Let me get a picture of
you strangling my kid.

291
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:50,345
No.

292
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,392
Hey, we pay your salary.

293
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:57,553
I never wanted to be famous
for being mean.

294
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:01,470
I wanted to be famous
for catching Santa Claus.

295
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,447
Let's just go back to the condo.

296
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:06,153
We have to wash the dishes
and do the sheets

297
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:08,083
so it's nice
for the next people.

298
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,509
I can't believe
what I've done.

299
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,955
Maybe deep down I always knew
how much this film would hurt them.

300
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:16,433
Maybe I'm the monster
this movie exposed.

301
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,206
Now what kind
of talk is that?

302
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:21,135
Oh, hi,
Mr. Jarmusch.

303
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:25,283
Lisa, I've been following your
family's turmoil closely, and I can relate.

304
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,607
My movies, like Stranger
than Paradise and Down by Law,

305
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:31,573
are also about social misfits
experiencing the dark side

306
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,049
of the American dream.

307
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,645
I'm doing it again in my next
film, Cheaper by the Dozen 3.

308
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,914
That doesn't sound
like your kind of movie.

309
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,028
It will be. Check out the poster.

310
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:47,038
So, do you think my family
will ever forgive me

311
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,827
for making them a laughingstock?

312
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:52,000
The answer to that is
where it always is: in a movie.

313
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,403
Let's take a look.

314
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:03,164
Nelson? He couldn't have made
a movie by himself.

315
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:04,291
Who helped him?

316
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:05,953
Chalmskinn.

317
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:09,131
Seymour Skinner never puts
all his eggs in one basket.

318
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:12,192
That's why they call me
"Two Basket" Skinner.

319
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,019
What? They do.

320
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,290
I'm Nelson.

321
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,682
This is my house.

322
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:20,245
This is the impound lot that my
house gets towed to every night.

323
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,099
Let's get going.

324
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,638
We got to swing by the Laundromat,
steal me a new bra.

325
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:27,383
You're going to be the classiest girl
at Classy Girls.

326
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,629
No, no, no,
don't go in there.

327
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,051
Oh, no, he did.

328
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:40,260
Oh, man, that
is messed up.

329
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:42,198
Whoa, what the
hell is that?

330
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,198
It's just a cat.

331
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,075
What?

332
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:47,042
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
now I see it.

333
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:50,826
Mom, there's
this school play tonight.

334
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,221
It's called Kids Are People Too,

335
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:57,212
and I play a grown-up who doesn't
think kids are people, too.

336
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:59,907
So if you want
to come...

337
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:02,391
Can't. I'm organizing
my Laramie Bucks.

338
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:05,323
If I want that golf umbrella,
I got to get to smoking.

339
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:13,542
Sometimes
I take the long way home,

340
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:15,913
past the happy people's houses.

341
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:21,477
I like to look inside and pretend
I have a family like theirs.

342
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:49,136
I like to cry at the ocean,
because only there

343
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:51,594
do my tears seem small.

344
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:07,987
Thank you, Mr. Jarmusch.

345
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:09,866
You have taught me
a valuable lesson:

346
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:13,149
that other people have bigger
family problems than I do.

347
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,886
True, but I was also teaching
you that festival buzz is,

348
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:19,820
like my movie Coffee and
Cigarettes, a funny thing.

349
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:22,135
- Did you see it?
- Well, I, uh...

350
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:24,358
That's okay. I know you did.

351
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,399
I like this movie
way better

352
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,888
than the one by that little girl

353
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:29,977
'cause I saw this one today.

354
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,589
Wow, I guess
Nelson's the hot thing now.

355
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,820
My movie will probably
never be seen.

356
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:38,883
Oh, it will... on select flights
by Alaska Airlines

357
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:40,808
and its regional partners.

358
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:43,905
Okay,
only its regional partners. The point is:

359
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,600
you made a great movie
and you ought to be proud.

360
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:49,247
And now, like the best
independent films,

361
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:51,988
I must fade out
with a cool dissolve.

362
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:55,257
That hurts.

363
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:02,900
Hey, Nelson, say
something poor.

364
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,803
Oh, thank God they're not
jeering at us anymore.

365
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:10,154
I know.

366
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:12,576
- Kind of miss it.
- I know!

367
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:16,210
We'll be in another movie, and
this time we'll act really bad.

368
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:17,991
No more
Simpsons movies.

369
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,604
One was plenty.

370
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,660
Are you guys
still mad at me?

371
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:23,618
We know you love us,
honey,

372
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:26,845
even though sometimes
you show it in a "quirky" way.

373
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:33,621
I'm not going
to lie to you guys.

374
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:36,611
John C. Reilly would love to be
in the Chalmskinn business.

375
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,126
Well, did you read
my script?

376
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:41,617
Read it? I lived it. I am Ghost Willie.
Check this out.

377
00:20:46,352 --> 00:20:49,121
Fantastic. Gre... oh, bravo.

378
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,728
You nailed it.

379
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,525
I don't know. He, he
seems a little needy.

380
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:55,640
Pass.

381
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:57,247
We'll see you on the set.

382
00:20:57,248 --> 00:20:58,156
Yes!

383
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:07,034
Chalmskinn.

384
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,319
Another hit.

385
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,626
Skinner!

386
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:13,264
Why can't you be
a gentle clinker?

387
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,468
