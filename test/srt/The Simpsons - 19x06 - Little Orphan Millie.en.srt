1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,788
The Simpsons S19E06 (JABF22)
Little Orphan Millie

2
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:16,979
<i>There is no such thing as an iPoddy.</i>

3
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,367
<i>Modern couch gag
10 couch gags to spice up your marriage</i>

4
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:22,964
There's a bee on Maggie.

5
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:28,187
Okay, Maggie, just calmly and
carefully back away.

6
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,226
Beehive!

7
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:32,809
Blueberries!

8
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:43,229
I told you not to mock
me at picnics.

9
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,419
Uh, attention, everyone.

10
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,870
Uh, Luann and I
have some big news.

11
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:51,212
Is it that you're
brother and sister?

12
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,414
Because you really
look a lot alike.

13
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:54,033
No.

14
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,392
Half-brother
and half-sister?

15
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:55,942
No!

16
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,822
Siamese twins who've been
surgically separated?

17
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:58,541
No.

18
00:01:58,546 --> 00:01:59,883
We're getting remarried.

19
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,890
- Oh, that's great.
- Great. Ooh, cool.

20
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:04,260
Way to go.
Many happy returns.

21
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:06,421
This is so awesome.

22
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,302
Finally you guys will stop using

23
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:10,223
me as a pawn in your fights.

24
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:12,472
Milhouse, you're
not a pawn.

25
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:13,611
I know, I know.

26
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:15,121
Did your father
say you were?

27
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,283
No. I swear.

28
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,691
I made it up.
Like kids do.

29
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:20,751
Well, now that we're
a family again,

30
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,783
you can stop your lying.

31
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,382
Homer.

32
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,160
The wedding's in 20 minutes.

33
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,670
Just pick a tie.

34
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:32,563
There are so many choices.

35
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,783
Bolo? Clip-on? Piano keys?

36
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:36,461
Ten Commandments of Beer?

37
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:39,242
The cornerstones
of the Brewish faith.

38
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:41,063
Why don't you wear a tie

39
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:42,922
that goes with my eyes?

40
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:45,460
And what color would that be?

41
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:48,080
You don't know what
color my eyes are?!

42
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,932
Of course I know.

43
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,220
No peeking.

44
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,400
I'm waiting.

45
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:54,430
Uh...

46
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:56,911
You really don't
know, do you?

47
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,871
Is "beautiful" a color?

48
00:02:58,876 --> 00:02:59,701
No.

49
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,072
Marge, give me a break.

50
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't notice the color
of people's eyes.

51
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,203
I just judge them on
the color of their skin.

52
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:05,711
Fine.

53
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:07,291
Since the color-- ah!--

54
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:08,800
of my eyes isn't-- ooh!--

55
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,353
important to you-- aah!--

56
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:11,970
then you don't get to-- Mmm!--

57
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:12,970
see them until you--

58
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:14,953
ow!-- remember.

59
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,180
Oh!

60
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:18,731
<i>Please do not kick sea turtles</i>

61
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,483
She's wearing white?

62
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:31,680
She must have rolled
the odometer back to zero.

63
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:36,600
So you're good at
noticing dress colors,

64
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:39,560
but not the eyes
that make your dinner.

65
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,711
We are gathered here in the sight of

66
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:46,473
God and this unsafe-for-swimming beach

67
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:51,483
to celebrate the holy un-divorcing
of Kirk and Luann.

68
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:53,143
Ow! What the...?

69
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,682
Little help?

70
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:58,443
Spaz.

71
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:04,492
Do you, Kirk,
take Luann to re-have and re-hold?

72
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,272
I do.

73
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:08,090
And do you, Luann, take Kirk--

74
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,923
despite the fact that he is
fundamentally the same man

75
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:14,130
that you said in court was unfit
to load your dishwasher?

76
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:16,963
Whose very touch repulsed you?

77
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,081
- Uh, your...
- Whose many annoying...

78
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:21,493
Uh, you're readingan
early draft of our vows.

79
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:22,442
Just say "I do."

80
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:23,110
I do.

81
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:25,012
You may now kiss the bride.

82
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:25,891
But make it quick.

83
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:28,413
The seagulls have gotten
into the hors d'oeuvres.

84
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:31,203
My friends, do not eat.

85
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:32,862
Is made with seagull meat.

86
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,381
See you in a week, Milhouse.

87
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:37,321
Have fun at the Simpsons'.

88
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:39,301
If you don't like
Mrs. Simpsons' cooking,

89
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:40,903
you have your "mommy meals."

90
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,221
I got 'em. Mm, mm.

91
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:45,813
Why does every kid who stays
with us bring "mommy meals"?

92
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:48,293
So I put pineapple
in my potato salad.

93
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:49,991
Live a little, huh?

94
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:54,383
That's why, to this day,

95
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:58,630
you never see a shark
with monkey arms.

96
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:01,523
Great story, Mr. Simpson.

97
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:02,931
But why do all your bedroom stories
have

98
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:04,691
commercials in them
for The Container Store?

99
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:06,663
Because if I do it enough,

100
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,053
maybe they'll start to pay me.

101
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:11,131
Sleep tight.

102
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:13,873
The Container Store, no wat
five convenient locations.

103
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,010
Ah... now that my mom and
dad are back together,

104
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,763
I'm happy every day.

105
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,922
I can't wait to wake up
so tomorrow can start.

106
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,420
<i>Countdown to wake-up time</i>

107
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:36,681
Whoa...

108
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:39,981
Uh-uh-uh.

109
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:42,160
We're gonna start
this marriage off right.

110
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:46,542
This time, I'm gonna carry you
over the threshold.

111
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:54,880
Dear God!

112
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:57,231
I need more nickels!

113
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:02,642
Luann, is that you
nibbling on my knee?

114
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:08,580
Check it out, an animal hole.

115
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,952
Where does it go?

116
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,611
Only one way to find out.

117
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,153
Ah...! Tarantulas!

118
00:06:22,158 --> 00:06:24,820
I'll save you,
Baby Burps-A-Lot.

119
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,350
Ah...! Spider burps!

120
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:35,763
This week is the best.

121
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:38,710
I don't care if my parent
sever come back.

122
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:56,662
Milhouse Van Houten?

123
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,253
Yes?

124
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:02,042
Son, your parents
have been lost at sea.

125
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:02,941
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:04,381
Oh my God!

127
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:07,091
I said I didn't care if
they ever came back!

128
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:09,213
This is my fault!

129
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:13,740
Drown, monster, drown!

130
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:18,192
Hey, who died?

131
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,911
My parents, probably.

132
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:24,493
So you guys aren't
ice cream men?

133
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,860
If my parents are lost at sea,

134
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:33,952
are you gonna find 'em?

135
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:37,343
We'll try, but have you ever
been to the sea?

136
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:38,360
It's huge.

137
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:39,672
And we have to search all of them--

138
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:41,383
'cause they all,you know, connect.

139
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:43,510
Don't worry, boy.

140
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:45,332
They'll find your parents soon.

141
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,930
And until they do, you can stay here.

142
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:51,203
And we'll move your bedtime
to an hour later,

143
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:54,570
so you'll have more time to
be alone with your thoughts.

144
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,552
Hey, hey, come on.

145
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:06,024
Why don't you cheer up
with a glass of Ocean Spray?

146
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:08,773
Oh, boy forget that.

147
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,652
How about some...?

148
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:10,603
Cap'n crunch

149
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,603
Uh, Seven Seas Italian dressing?

150
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:14,843
Ooh! No, no!

151
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,460
Uh, Chicken of the Sea tuna?

152
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:20,181
Billy Ocean CD?
The History of Atlantic Records?

153
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,551
Stop naming things!

154
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:22,760
I want to, but I can't!

155
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,153
Then go to Moe's!

156
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:25,100
Good idea.

157
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:27,450
I'll drown my sorrows
in Anchor Steam Beer.

158
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,370
Oh! I'm sorry...

159
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:36,420
Why don't we do something special for you
get you all snazzed up.

160
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,771
Like I'm going to a funeral?

161
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:40,693
No! Don't talk like that!

162
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,222
There's always hope.

163
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:44,761
We just wanted to let you know,
we've stopped searching.

164
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:47,232
This'll cheer you up.

165
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:50,163
I'll let you kill me in Bar Brawl Four: Final Fracas.

166
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,250
Take that I'll cut ya...!

167
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:55,592
Uh-oh. I slipped on some blood.

168
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,250
I'm totally vulnerable to

169
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:59,072
a full-body jukebox slam.

170
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,430
Oh, come on, it's easy.

171
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:06,352
Just push A, B, up, up, left trigger,
right trigger, and both triggers at once.

172
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:09,921
Isn't there already enough pain in this world?

173
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:13,211
Let's just pay the check and go.

174
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,490
Thanks, Mags.

175
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:32,000
I could use a pick-me-up.

176
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:40,822
Oh, my God.

177
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:43,501
I've become the world's oldest baby.

178
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:46,593
Men don't get their moo-moo from a ba-ba.

179
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:51,143
They get their moo-moo
from a big-boy cup!

180
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:56,011
I can't be a baby anymore.

181
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,491
I'm alone now.

182
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,852
I have to be a man!

183
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:01,403
Thanks, Mags.

184
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,572
Where is it?

185
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:14,183
I gotta find out what
color Marge's eyes are.

186
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:14,910
Ah...

187
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,853
Cha-ching!

188
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:20,451
Oh!

189
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,030
Oh, Marge, darling,

190
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,953
what's the combination
to our wedding album?

191
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:27,751
Our anniversary!

192
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:30,113
D'oh!

193
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,130
All right, Dragon's Eye,

194
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:37,241
may your path be true
and your caroms many.

195
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:38,492
Just shoot!

196
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,912
Uh-oh, it's rolling to wards that loner!

197
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,222
Who is it?

198
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:49,800
It's Milhouse!

199
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:52,151
That's not the Milhouse I know.

200
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:52,953
Ha! ha!

201
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:54,712
You know Milhouse!

202
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:55,790
Okay, everyone.

203
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,341
My best friend
is a little messed up,

204
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:59,940
so everyone
be extra nice to him.

205
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:02,191
Hey, loser, your mom called.

206
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:10,521
One day, you'll be more haunted
by those words than I am.

207
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,451
Why aren't you crying?

208
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,633
I wish I could cry.

209
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:16,820
Tears would cleanse my soul.

210
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,450
Oh, Milhouse!

211
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:21,363
You're very brave.

212
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,922
Go ahead, beat me up.

213
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:26,260
Maybe then I'll feel something.

214
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:35,093
Eh, what's the point?

215
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:39,890
Milhouse, that was the bravest
thing I've ever seen.

216
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,721
I always wanted you
to hold my hand, Lisa.

217
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:45,982
And now that you are, I'm
too numb to feel anything.

218
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,650
It's like you're wearing oven mitts
and I'm in my winter parka.

219
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:52,561
That's so poetic.

220
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:56,073
Looks like you're not the coolest
kid in school anymore.

221
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:59,191
Hey, I'm happy to see Milhouse
get some hand-on-hand action.

222
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:02,801
But no one is cooler than
Bartholomew J. Simpson.

223
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,921
Really?
See ya at lunch.

224
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,311
Anyone want to sit over here?

225
00:12:10,637 --> 00:12:12,013
You can have my pizza crust.

226
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:15,380
Young man, you look like
you enjoy fun and excitement.

227
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:18,111
Please, Bart, you're
embarrassing yourself.

228
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:28,001
Milhouse, call me
if you need to talk.

229
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:33,571
If you want to come to my place,
I've got a squirrel in a shoebox.

230
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:35,152
I'm just sayin'...

231
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,293
Thanks, but I want to take
a walk alone...

232
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:41,682
...and work some stuff out.

233
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,883
Come on!
Look at me, I'm cool.

234
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:49,671
I've got my backpack on frontwards,

235
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,170
and I'm krumping!

236
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:56,203
Check it out!

237
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,052
This image has not been speed up.

238
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,121
There's a time for krumping,
and this isn't it.

239
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:12,453
I'll krump with you, sweetie pie.

240
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,090
Look at these poll numbers.

241
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:32,332
Ay, caramba!

242
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,112
Oh, man.

243
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,551
Milhouse has gone from being
a comic figure to a tragic one.

244
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:39,461
If he could go back to being happy,

245
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:41,112
I could go back to being cool.

246
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:43,073
Boy, stop talking to yourself.

247
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,233
Your thoughts should stay
in your head.

248
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:47,192
I sure told him.

249
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,703
Now what am I going
to do about Marge?

250
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:51,333
Let's see.

251
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:55,291
Milhouse would be happy again
if he had family to take care of him.

252
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:57,332
Family, family.

253
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,260
Every Christmas...

254
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:02,151
Milhouse gets
Danish butter cookies from...

255
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:04,433
Solvang, California...

256
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:08,721
where he has a beloved un... cle!

257
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,073
Directory assistance for Solvang,

258
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:16,052
a little bit of Denmark
on California's central coast.

259
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:18,413
We have three Van Houtens.

260
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,872
Fine, I'll call three numbers.

261
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,153
What are they?

262
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:24,490
Butter cookie 8-2147,

263
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:27,150
Hans Christian Anderson 5-5166,

264
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,731
and Aquavit 3-2599.

265
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:44,583
Okay, so which one of these losers

266
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:46,441
is Milhouse's Uncle Norbert?

267
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:48,282
Norbert? Norbert?

268
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,330
Oh, this guy's a total Norbert.

269
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,513
Norbert? I wish.

270
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:54,281
My name is Gaylord Q. Tinkledink.

271
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,470
Bart, I'm Norbert Van Houten,
but everyone calls me Zack.

272
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:09,892
You're Uncle Norbert?

273
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,072
Well, I'm one
of the Danish Van Houtens,

274
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,940
not the Dutch Van Houtens.

275
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,792
Now, my nephew Milhouse needs
me and I'm here for him.

276
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,843
And I'm here to find my nephew
Nerdletaub Z. Pantybottom.

277
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,242
Let us join forces.

278
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:27,542
Would you be my uncle?

279
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,270
No, but have a butter cookie.

280
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:40,850
Milhouse, there's someone
who wants to see you.

281
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:44,572
Uncle Zack?

282
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:48,323
Milhouse, your parents may be
gone, but I'm here for you now.

283
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:51,082
Well, I don't need you.

284
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,423
I've learned to take care of myself.

285
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:54,772
I see.

286
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,320
You've become quite a young man--

287
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:57,902
self-reliant, mature.

288
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:00,880
You've shed your Dutch ways
and become a true Dane.

289
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:03,480
But, uh, perhaps you're not too cool

290
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:05,431
to give your uncle a hug?

291
00:16:07,786 --> 00:16:11,580
I promise you won't be
alone anymore, son.

292
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:18,751
And that takes care of that.

293
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,600
Oh, man, now he's
even more popular.

294
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,352
He's troubled, but I can save him.

295
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,502
Oh, for crying out loud.

296
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:34,603
Oh, I'll never remember
what color Marge's eyes are.

297
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,332
Uh... brown? No.

298
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:38,930
Orange? No.

299
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:41,603
Elm? Rake?
Guessing?

300
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:48,420
Well, well, look who's strolling
down Alzheimer Avenue.

301
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:51,083
You used to know everything
about that wife of yours,

302
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:52,883
even wrote a song about her.

303
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:54,683
A song?

304
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,402
Wait, it's coming back to me.

305
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,970
The girl I love's
got beautiful hair

306
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:07,082
A blue bouffant

307
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:09,981
From here to there

308
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,153
Snow white teeth and lips so red

309
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,930
She's the Wilma to my Fred

310
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,342
Oh, the girl I love's got beautiful...

311
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:21,610
Eyes

312
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:25,362
When happy, they sparkle,
when sad, they cries

313
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:27,830
Those eyes are gems beyond appraisal

314
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:29,611
Stunning shade of purest...

315
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,152
Oh, what is it?

316
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,603
I was so close.

317
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:34,211
Let's see, what rhymes
with appraisal?

318
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:36,130
Basil, nasal.

319
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:38,050
None of these are colors.

320
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,381
Oh, it's hopeless.

321
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,432
She'll never love me again.

322
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:43,382
Oh, Homie.

323
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:47,501
I'd forgotten that beautiful
song you wrote for me.

324
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:51,793
Hazel!

325
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:54,402
Your eyes are hazel.

326
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:58,600
Hazel like the pussy willows
by the pond where we first kissed,

327
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,090
like the almond paste
in the bear claw I ate

328
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,203
after we first made love.

329
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,983
Milhouse, that was a perfect landing.

330
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,302
Oh, did you remember to
cut off the gas flow?

331
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:20,521
The what?

332
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:28,202
Lis, I don't get it.

333
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,972
Why does Milhouse's happiness
make me sad?

334
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:32,570
Bart, Bart, Bart.

335
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:34,700
You're worried
you're losing Milhouse,

336
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,850
and love is a selfish thing.

337
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:39,063
Shut up! I don't love Milhouse.

338
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:39,952
Oh, really?

339
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:41,642
The more you deny it,
the more I know it's true.

340
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:44,592
Oh, yeah? Well, when you're mean,
I'm a trampoline,

341
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:46,953
so everything you said goes
back and hits your ugly head.

342
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:50,750
God, that was lame.

343
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,022
Where did you get that?

344
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:53,300
From Milhouse!

345
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:56,370
Oh, I love him so much!

346
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:58,451
Aw, it's okay.

347
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:01,770
Students, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

348
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,420
The coolest student in school,
Milhouse Van Houten,

349
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,372
is leaving us.

350
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,451
He and his uncle,
who is also very cool,

351
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:13,291
will be returning to Solvang
forever via hot air balloon.

352
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:16,203
Our trip will be fraught
with hardship and peril,

353
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:18,973
but it still beats third-period
gym with Mr. Johnson.

354
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,472
Hey, in the real world,
rope-climbing skills are vital.

355
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:25,291
Good-bye, old life.

356
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:30,271
Wait, Milhouse!

357
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,151
Don't go!

358
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:32,702
You're my best friend.

359
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,003
I have to go.

360
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,652
Well, then I'm going with you.

361
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,672
Bart, climb up.

362
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,353
I... can't.

363
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,921
Well, what do you think of
Mr. Johnson's rope-climbing class now?

364
00:19:44,305 --> 00:19:46,653
- Still sucks!
- Come on.

365
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,370
So who's up for a
trip around the world?

366
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,043
I am, I am!

367
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,730
If we can catch the trade winds,

368
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:10,421
we'll be in the Florida Keys
by tomorrow morning.

369
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:17,970
I can't wait to see our little...

370
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:19,553
Milhouse!

371
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:21,682
Mom and Dad!

372
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:22,760
Mr. and Mrs. Van Houten!

373
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,050
Damned Dutchmen!

374
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:32,440
I'm so glad you're alive!

375
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:35,251
I'll never have to be
self-reliant again.

376
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:38,480
Not so fast, son.
We are trapped on this island.

377
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:41,130
No worries. I've already
radioed for a rescue boat

378
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,143
sailed by brave Danish sailors.

379
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,832
More like swishy Danish sailors.

380
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:47,681
You're going down, Dutchman.

381
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:50,872
You grapple like a girl!

382
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,093
