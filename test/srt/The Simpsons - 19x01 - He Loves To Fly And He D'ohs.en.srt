Thanks to swsub.com
for the transcript.

5
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:55,451
All right,
next on my shopping list...

6
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:58,144
a new phone.

7
00:01:00,303 --> 00:01:03,439
Attention, shoppers,
Iphone is now 20 cents.

8
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:05,908
What happened to that
mini-cell phone I gave you, Sir ?

9
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,583
Ooh, I thought it
was a lemon drop.

10
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:12,630
I'll go get
the number de-listed.

11
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:20,683
Well, well.
What have we here ?

12
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:25,280
Why do I need another penny ?

13
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,482
I have Billions.

14
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:29,988
Still, if I don't take it,
that hoodlum over there might.

15
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:35,121
All right, penny,
prepare to be pinched.

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,703
Come to Papa.

17
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:42,846
Help...me !

18
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,697
Help...me !

19
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:46,347
Help me !

20
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:52,884
<i>I guess this is the end.</i>

21
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:55,607
<i>I just wish, i had spent more time
at the office.</i>

22
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:05,417
Hey, you're not a penny !

23
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:06,798
You saved my life !

24
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,769
There must be something,
I can do for you ?

25
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,807
<i>A cookie ! No, a car !
No, a cookie !</i>

26
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:12,724
You're getting a free dinner.

27
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,818
- With...  - Yeah ?
- Me !

28
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,311
"Me" ? But that's you !

29
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,283
I'll pick you up
at 5:00 tomorrow.

30
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:20,666
And I'll pick you up
right now.

31
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:25,978
Got It.

32
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:29,265
See you at 5:00, then.

33
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,091
Dinner with Mr. Burns...

34
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:35,338
what a waste of my precious,
precious, Saturday night.

35
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,187
Hey dad ! Have fun
with your boyfriend.

36
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:39,450
He is not my boyfriend !

37
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:44,180
So, Simpson,
I hear you like pizza pie.

38
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:44,997
I do.

39
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:48,013
- My favorite is chicago deep-dish.
- Chicago, eh ?

40
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,503
Well... What if I took us
there now ?

41
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:52,184
Drive to Chicago ?

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,545
I don't have time for that.

43
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,097
I have to be back at work on Monday,
and my boss is a total jerk.

44
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,247
Who said anything about drive ?

45
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:01,764
A p-private jet !

46
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,253
Now would you care for some sushi ?

47
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:12,501
Uh, yeah, but i'm on a plane, idiot.

48
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,817
My name is Svetlana,
but you can call me, "Hey Baby."

49
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,822
And just so you know,...

50
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:24,460
she'll do anything for you.

51
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:25,916
Anything except sex !

52
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:29,202
And i do mean, anything.

53
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:32,101
Ooh, I'm aroused...

54
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:34,158
and confused.

55
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,996
... Scratchy Show !

56
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:47,412
Stewardess !

57
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:59,247
Sorry, everyone.

58
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:02,986
Air traffic control says we have
to spend another three hours...

59
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,113
on the tarmac.

60
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:09,864
This is wonderful.

61
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:12,173
Now, why don't you listen
to the musical stylings...

62
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,310
of Mr. Lionel Richie ?

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,441
Oh, my God ! Lionel Richie !

64
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,425
Can you sing "Say You Say Me",
but make it about beer ?

65
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,476
Sure, I guess.

66
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:22,800
<i>Hey, you, beer me.

67
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,960
Beer me for always.

68
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:27,278
That's the way it should be.

69
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,498
Hey, you, beer me.

70
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,571
Beer us together...

71
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,496
naturally.</i>

72
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,487
Now make every word beer !

73
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:39,104
<i>Beer, beer.

74
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,963
Beer, Beer

75
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:43,733
Beer, beer, beer, beer.</i>

76
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:45,310
Huh, wait i forgot the word.

77
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:55,222
Love you.

78
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,733
If i leave the plane,
i'll be just like every one else !

79
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:06,517
Ground control,
this is November 543 Charlie.

80
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:07,879
We're gonna need the extractor.

81
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:21,901
I want to be back on the plane.

82
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,939
We'll be back before you know it.

83
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,035
Svetlana ! Svetlana !

84
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,410
Now let's enjoy
the Miami of Canada...

85
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:34,658
Chicago !

86
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:54,131
Okay, folks !
For our first improv...

87
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,722
we gonna need an occupation.

88
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:56,694
Billionaire !

89
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,666
Oh, oh, Nice job !
Where do I apply ?

90
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:01,144
Now, i need a location.

91
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:03,100
I came to relax.
You think of it.

92
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:06,405
I hear " a Starbucks...in Siberia".

93
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:07,647
Killer premise.

94
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:09,666
Finally, an emotion.

95
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,037
Drunk !

96
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:12,304
Okay, "drunk".

97
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:14,896
And now we take you
to a drunken billionaire...

98
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,283
at a Starbucks in Siberia.

99
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,903
Uh, excuse me.

100
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,681
I need a, I need a coffee.

101
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:27,056
Can you change
a billion dollar bill ?

102
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,582
Our coffee costs a billion dollars.

103
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:30,884
This is Starbucks.

104
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:33,048
In Siberia.

105
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:38,630
Why are you applauding them ?
We wrote it.

106
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:45,459
While you were here,
we felt like New York !

107
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:50,993
I'm so happy.

108
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:03,367
Homer, you smell like Chicago.

109
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,630
Did fly there
on a commercial airline ?

110
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:08,575
No way ! Commercial is for losers
and terrorists.

111
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,585
I flew on a private plane.

112
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:13,831
It is much different
from a normal plane ?

113
00:07:13,972 --> 00:07:15,841
Please, tell me you're joking.

114
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,080
It's the difference between
champagne and carbonated pee.

115
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:21,522
Homie, what's wrong ?

116
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:23,234
I had it all for one night.

117
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:26,101
Now for the rest of my life,
i'll know what i'm missing.

118
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,777
And all i have to remember it by...

119
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,382
is that my ears haven't popped.

120
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:32,362
Well, i'll make sure that
I never yawn again !

121
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:33,142
Hey, Homer.

122
00:07:43,549 --> 00:07:45,014
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

123
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,155
High like a private plane ?

124
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,234
The kind I'll never be
invited to ride on again.

125
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,760
That's where
you're wrong, Homer.

126
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,834
A fresh face!

127
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:56,420
This is Colby Krause.

128
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,863
I hired him to help you,
improve your life.

129
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:01,849
He'll get you back on
a private plane in no time.

130
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,013
No way.

131
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:05,507
I don't need any shrink,
therapist,...

132
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,568
counselor, motivational
speaker or "guru. "

133
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,926
I'm a life coach.

134
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:11,306
Oh, tell me more.

135
00:08:11,353 --> 00:08:13,325
The first step in self-improvement...

136
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:15,456
is to take a thorough
look at your life.

137
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:16,518
If you're gonna film me,...

138
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,142
I insist on a body double.

139
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:20,207
Is uncle fester still alive ?

140
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,797
- The camera is not done yet right ?
- No.

141
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:27,521
Okay, now I just want you to do...

142
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,295
what you normally do.

143
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:30,263
Okay.

144
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:34,312
Well, uh...
Hmm, I'll just, hu...

145
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,261
I forget what i do.

146
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,224
Wait, what ?

147
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,933
Uh, this is some
of what I do... I think.

148
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,693
Sometimes I go places.

149
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,770
This is our relish tray.

150
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,790
I'd like you to film it
for insurance purposes.

151
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,840
Oh, what's the point
of putting my socks on ?

152
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:54,610
I just have to take them off
again a week later.

153
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,811
Homer, before you even
head out the door, in the morning,...

154
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,158
you're already a loser.

155
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:02,853
Fine, I'll show you a winner,
just you watch.

156
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,681
Think positive, think positive.

157
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,299
You were saying ?

158
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,017
Homer, your journey downstairs
would've been a lot safer...

159
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,332
if you'd rembered
the NDCs of concentration:

160
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,965
Never Don't Concentrate.

161
00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:25,549
Will you shut up ?

162
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:26,976
I can't hear the song
in my head!

163
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,976
Do you want to get a
reaction shot of his butt?

164
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:33,210
No, but we should
get some background noise.

165
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,623
Everyone quiet for four seconds.

166
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,300
Thank you people.
Moving on.

167
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,158
What ?

168
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:49,979
Here's an important tip:
Stop doing that.

169
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:56,057
I really enjoyed
paying you to yell at me...

170
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:58,423
and say I suck,
but it's no use.

171
00:09:58,461 --> 00:10:00,592
I'm a hopeless loser
and always will be.

172
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:01,472
Homer, you're up!

173
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:02,994
This I can do!

174
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:18,932
- Whoa ! Boom !
- Way to go !

175
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,304
Behold my 217
average and weep.

176
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:25,520
As I said,
I've lost all hope.

177
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:27,419
Homer, here in
the bowling alley,...

178
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:29,147
you're a totally
different man...

179
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:30,705
relaxed, confident...

180
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:32,752
Is this going somewhere?

181
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:34,778
But what we have to do
is figure a way...

182
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,562
to make "Bowling Alley Homer"
into "Everyday Homer. "

183
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,297
I have an aunt
who became an uncle.

184
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:41,396
Is it like that?

185
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,957
I want you to wear
those bowling shoes...

186
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,117
out the door and
everywhere you go.

187
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,812
It's crazy, but
it just might work.

188
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:54,331
Dr. Fredrick J. Waxman,
you're a genius!

189
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,749
That's not my name.

190
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,007
I wasn't talking to you.

191
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,726
Homer, your shoe attitude...

192
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,247
is bowling people over.

193
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:14,763
These are letters
from companies...

194
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:16,594
interested in
interviewing you !

195
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:18,589
How many of those
have private planes ?

196
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:19,726
This one !

197
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,235
"Handyman's Choice
Copper Tubing" ?

198
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:25,170
They need
a safety inspector to fly...

199
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,739
between their North American plants.

200
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,556
I'm getting that job.

201
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:31,007
Bart, I'll need some clean urine.
Stat.

202
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:34,555
Now to make sure you're
motivated to get this job,...

203
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:35,982
you have to quit
your old one.

204
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:37,494
I'll call your boss right now.

205
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:42,402
I'll get it, sir.

206
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,120
Just send it
to voice mail.

207
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:51,493
You here for the
safety inspector job ?

208
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,018
Well, i can see
the position of handsomest CEO...

209
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,379
is already taken.

210
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:57,870
I like you already.

211
00:11:57,975 --> 00:12:00,499
If you can write your name
so I can read it, you're in.

212
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,841
I got the job !

213
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,261
Yay, Dad !

214
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:07,870
We knew you could do it !

215
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,159
Good luck
on your first day, Dad.

216
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,274
Give 'em
hell, Homer.

217
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:23,011
We're all so proud
of you, sweetie.

218
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:27,434
I'm gonna get there early,
so I can get in good...

219
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,572
with the lunch truck guy.

220
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:30,063
Find out if he
has a wife !

221
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,377
We could double date !

222
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,429
- Yay, Dad !
- You're a Hero.

223
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:49,294
Can I help you ?

224
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:52,374
Uh, yeah. I have no
job and nowhere to go.

225
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:55,275
What do I have to buy
so I can sit here all day ?

226
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:58,155
Well, with a coffee,
you can stay till lunch.

227
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:00,098
Then you have
to order a solid.

228
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,108
One small
coffee, please.

229
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:04,933
And a dozen of those
placemats with the maze on it.

230
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,933
They're all the same maze.

231
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:08,368
Somebody's got to do 'em.

232
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,560
Look happy.

233
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,636
So, how was your first day
at your new job ?

234
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:53,279
Oh, it was great !

235
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,157
Flew to Tulsa
on the company jet.

236
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:58,429
Did my job in a way consistent
with what I already told you.

237
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:00,401
Because, that's what you do.

238
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:01,949
When you have a job !

239
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,535
I'm so proud of you, Dad !

240
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:05,948
Stop peppering me
with questions !

241
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,289
Principal Skinner !

242
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,688
Why did we have to leave...

243
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:13,476
the Learn and Touch
Reptile Zoo so early ?

244
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,645
Well, it seems
someone was riding...

245
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:17,636
the giant tortoise naked.

246
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:18,827
It's not my fault.

247
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,827
The drinking fountain
dared me to do it.

248
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:25,793
Freak fry !

249
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:26,553
Look out

250
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:29,135
If it touches you,
you die of suicide !

251
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:31,565
Don't do it ! Don't do it !

252
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:36,364
Dad ?

253
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,697
I know it's you, Homer.

254
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,724
Why aren't you
at your new job ?

255
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:56,320
Well, explanation-wise,
the fact is that...

256
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,551
I lied.
I didn't get the job.

257
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,922
You see when
I got there.

258
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:03,509
So, she said,
"That's not my in-box,"...

259
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:06,608
and he said,
"That's not the Johnson Report !"

260
00:15:08,718 --> 00:15:12,052
You sure know how to repeat
the joke I just told ya.

261
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,219
But as a formality, I must ask :

262
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:19,411
Do you know
anything about copper tubing ?

263
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,099
Come on, say
"You're hired"!

264
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,446
Say it !

265
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,168
Leave your resume with Cheryl.

266
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:31,286
Say it !

267
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,979
Security ! Security !

268
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:35,425
Stop saying
"Security"!

269
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:38,007
Come on,
just give me the job.

270
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:40,207
I like your hat.

271
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,344
Just say the word !

272
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,609
I couldn't bear to
tell your mother,...

273
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:48,510
so I hang out
here all day.

274
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,248
But, Dad,
you gotta tell her.

275
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,524
She's been buying
brand-name groceries.

276
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,870
Brands like "Miser's Choice"
and "Day-Old Delights"?

277
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,912
No, things
rich people buy,...

278
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:58,790
like Campbell's Soup
and Pepsodent.

279
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,001
Hello ?

280
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:09,810
Honey, there's something
I have to tell you.

281
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,735
It's bad news, isn't it ?

282
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,500
I should never get my hopes up.

283
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,542
Nothing ever works out for us.

284
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,221
No, it's, uh...

285
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,357
- good news !
- Really ?

286
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:23,678
We're manufacturing
a new pipe diameter,...

287
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:24,687
five-eights inch.

288
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:28,448
The company wants you and me
to take the private plane...

289
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:30,314
to New York for the premiere !

290
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:32,990
So meet me at Shelbyville
Airport in an hour.

291
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:35,453
If I'm gonna tell
that woman the truth,...

292
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:37,131
I'm going to do it
in the one place...

293
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,493
no one can ever be sad.

294
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:42,039
Okay. So this should be
enough money...

295
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:44,809
to get me up in the air,
have a frank talk with Marge,...

296
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,558
then maybe eat a deviled egg.

297
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,361
Well, anything,
for a fellow Marine.

298
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:50,263
Yeah, semper fudge

299
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,645
Uh, did you just say
"Semper fudge"?

300
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:53,802
No, I said the
right thing.

301
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,806
Look at this business center...

302
00:16:56,865 --> 00:17:00,727
fax, Wi-Fi, teleconferencing
capabilities.

303
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,842
I'm gonna remember
this day for the rest of my life !

304
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,393
Uh, honey...

305
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,615
don't try to remember the whole day.

306
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:11,390
Just what you're
feeling this second.

307
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,684
Sweetheart, what do you mean?

308
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:15,576
Marge, I gotta be honest...

309
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,276
- What was that ?
- I don't know.

310
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:20,058
Maybe, we flew through a rainbow.

311
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,593
I didn't think I'd be flying today,
so I was doing heroin.

312
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,464
Homie, what are you doing ?

313
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:34,975
You don't know how to fly !

314
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:37,712
I drove a car over a cliff once.
How different could it be ?

315
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:41,336
Hmm, what's the ocean doing
in the sky ?

316
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,630
There's only one man
who can help us now.

317
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:50,948
Hello, and welcome to success.

318
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,107
It's Marge Simpson.

319
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:55,085
I need you to coach like
you've never coached before !

320
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,626
Marge, please,
I'm with a client.

321
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,311
Now you listen
here, bub !

322
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:03,172
We paid you all the savings
we had in the world.

323
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,224
You could at least tell my
husband something encouraging.

324
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,747
All right, Homer.
What is it you're attempting to do ?

325
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,229
Win over a difficult client ?

326
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,371
I'm trying to land a plane
with no experience.

327
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:15,685
Homer, I gotta tell you
I'm not very good.

328
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:17,607
I went to the Harvard
of the South.

329
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:18,825
Duke? That's good.

330
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,542
- Not Duke.
- Vanderbilt ?

331
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:23,461
A little further South.
Don't make me say it.

332
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:29,962
Duffman has reported you
to the FAA.

333
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:32,398
This near miss will be
investigated...

334
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,302
by a board of three
retired pilots.

335
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:38,383
Okay, Homer,
i don't know anything about planes,...

336
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:39,792
but I know about you.

337
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,257
You have what made America great :

338
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,243
No understanding of the limits
of your power,...

339
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,573
and a complete lack of concern
for what anyone thinks of you.

340
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:51,669
So you'll land that plane.
And do you know why ?

341
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:54,549
Because I heard some guy say
you couldn't.

342
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:56,486
What ? I'll show him.

343
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:58,261
I'll show that guy !

344
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:05,740
<i> Elevation 300 feet, 200 feet,
50 feet...</i>

345
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,151
Homer, you did it !

346
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:13,776
You landed a jet !

347
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,822
Now, to taxi to the terminal.

348
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:29,060
Marge, flying in private jets
is great and all,...

349
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:31,041
but it's just too dangerous.

350
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,614
That's why I've decided
to go to the plant...

351
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,346
and beg Mr. Burns
for my old job back.

352
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,370
I understand, Homie.

353
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,351
And at least we can take...

354
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,549
the extra income you've earned
in the last few months...

355
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,556
and set it aside for a rainy day.

356
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:46,321
You'd think so, but no.

357
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:50,939
Mr. Richie, your American Music
Awards are weighing us down !

358
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:52,122
Let them go !

359
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:53,905
You let yours go !

360
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,807
I don't have any.

361
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:56,272
That's right, you don't !



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
