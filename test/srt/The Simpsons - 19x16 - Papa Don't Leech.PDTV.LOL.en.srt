4
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:30,944
Dad, are you sure
you're okay to drive at night?

5
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:31,946
It's night?!

6
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:33,340
All right, that's it. Pull over.

7
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:34,577
Now don't you worry.

8
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:38,319
Just sit back and relax
to the smooth sounds of Tommy

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,615
Dorsey's All-White Orchestra.

10
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:43,956
Son, let this music take you

11
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:47,167
to a time when girls were girls
and a Hershey bar was

12
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:48,800
as thick as a phone book.

13
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:52,129
- I'm sick of this song!
- o/~ Catch a falling star and... o/~

14
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:53,503
I don't like this one either...

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,868
too optimistic!

16
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,077
Too slow!

17
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:57,389
Too fast!

18
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:58,813
No zazz!

19
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:00,052
Too much zazz!

20
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,347
More boogie!

21
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:02,391
Less woogie!

22
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:04,648
My back hurts!
All my friends are dead!

23
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:12,700
Nice one.

24
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,565
Thanks.

25
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:16,058
Oh, no, we're gonna die.

26
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:19,424
Oh, no, we're gonna die.

27
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,112
Oh, no...

28
00:01:44,664 --> 00:01:46,889
Son, call me an ambulance.

29
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,408
And while I'm in the hospital,

30
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,526
you'll have to visit me every day.

31
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:57,475
And then I'll have to come
live with you while I recover.

32
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:02,863
Eventually I'll die in your home,
which'll hurt the resale value,

33
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,292
but it'll all be...

34
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:13,757
Dad?

35
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:15,878
Dad? Wake up!

36
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,738
Who's... what, who?

37
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:20,026
Oh, I was having the
most wonderful dream.

38
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:21,387
I always wake up

39
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:23,385
just before the good part.

40
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:25,084
You can just drop me off here.

41
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:29,457
I'll see you later, honey.

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,117
Er, uh, yes?

43
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:41,022
I'm delivering your Scout
Gal Cookies, Mayor Quimby!

44
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,117
That'll be $30.

45
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:44,730
For three boxes?

46
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,458
The money helps us
serve the community.

47
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,906
We plant trees, pick up litter,
cut up milk bones

48
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:51,901
- for old dogs...
- It was rhetorical question.

49
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:54,005
And I used rhetoric in my answer?

50
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,528
Let's just move on.

51
00:02:57,809 --> 00:03:00,406
27 to the left and open.

52
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,738
Where's all the money?

53
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:07,358
Why, it's right...

54
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:10,944
We spent all our money on that
new slogan for Springfield.

55
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:14,874
Um, what say you
leave the cookies,

56
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,334
and I pay you double next year?

57
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,186
Sir, I didn't get this
"skepticism" merit badge

58
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:22,046
falling for promises like that.

59
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:24,730
If you don't give me
those cookies, I'll pass a law

60
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:27,546
forcing your organization
to accept gay scout leaders.

61
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,293
I would strongly support
that measure.

62
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:31,179
Just give me those cookies!

63
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:33,067
- You get it...
- Let go.

64
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:35,416
This is a low point
for my administration.

65
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,096
No. You give it.

66
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,301
People of Springfield,
our city is broke.

67
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,311
Uh, when you say broke,

68
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:45,861
do you mean really broke,
or uh, "O.J. Simpson broke"?

69
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:46,955
Really broke!

70
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:49,781
I've been reduced to using
this cheap novelty gavel.

71
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:54,701
Order! Order!

72
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,155
Homer Simpson.

73
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:59,887
I know a lot of you from church
and the market and such.

74
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,409
And I'm not much for talkin',
but seems to me,

75
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,935
in hard times like these
that we Americans come together.

76
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:11,931
So I say we roll up our sleeves,
and fake a disaster

77
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,624
to trick the federal government
out of relief money.

78
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:18,745
Rip off the federal government?

79
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,076
Mmm, I have reservations...

80
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,910
for dinner in five minutes.

81
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,761
So all in favor, say "aye"!

82
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:26,747
- Aye!
- The "ayes" have it.

83
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,066
Now, when exactly

84
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,994
did the hurricane pass
through your town?

85
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,943
Er, uh, five minutes ago.

86
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:37,096
You just missed it.

87
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:39,790
FEMA will help you
rebuild this town.

88
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:45,626
Your $10 million will arrive
as soon as you submit this form,

89
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:48,523
and the, uh,
$2,500 processing fee.

90
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,496
And that's how
a fake FEMA official scammed us

91
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:56,705
out of $2,500.
We are now worse than broke.

92
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,020
Panic not, fellow
Springfielders!

93
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:02,967
I've gone through the town's
financial records, and it turns out

94
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:06,144
there are millions
in uncollected city taxes.

95
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:10,495
We shall collect each
and every back tax owed!

96
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:12,183
Everyone from...

97
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:14,965
Comic Book Guy to...

98
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,919
... Milhouse!

99
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,547
No one shall be spared!

100
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,034
Dozens of swindling deadbeats,

101
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,829
as well as this respected reporter

102
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,663
who made an honest mistake,
have paid their back taxes,

103
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,089
leaving only one
outstanding debtor:

104
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,131
country music star

105
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:31,297
Lurleen Lumpkin,
seen here at the height of her fame.

106
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,150
o/~ Bunk with me

107
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:35,821
tonight, Kermit o/~

108
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:37,885
o/~ Bunk with me

109
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,163
tonight... o/~

110
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:41,370
Uh, really, Lurleen?

111
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:44,432
Hey, Dad,

112
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,804
that's the singer
you used to manage!

113
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,447
Oh, right.

114
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,634
Dad was Colonel Homer
and he wore that awesome suit

115
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:52,643
and Lurleen wanted
to bunk his brains out!

116
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,956
But I forget how Mom felt
about it.

117
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,709
Kids, marriage is like a car.

118
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:01,316
Along the way it has
its bumps and dings,

119
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:02,952
and this country
can't make one

120
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:04,726
that lasts more
than five years.

121
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,437
With Lurleen I just

122
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:09,409
walked past the showroom
and didn't even go inside.

123
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:12,017
Now let's return
to watching the news.

124
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:15,253
Ms. Lumpkin owed $50,000
in back taxes.

125
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:18,194
With penalties, interest and
the celebrity resentment tax,

126
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,672
that sum has grown
to $12 million.

127
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,745
However, she's been missing
for several years,

128
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:25,525
since her career went
into a downward spiral.

129
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:27,662
I told her not to go
into one of those.

130
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,723
The entire city
is searching for her.

131
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,904
Not for any reward,
but for the pleasure

132
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,181
of destroying someone
they once admired.

133
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:36,221
Save some for me!

134
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:46,865
Got her!

135
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,693
Krusty?

136
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:52,064
I just want to win
one thing in my life!

137
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:53,216
It's not real.

138
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:55,010
Don't you dare ruin
the moment!

139
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:59,441
Look at those idiots.

140
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:02,505
I bet Lurleen's a million miles
away right now.

141
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,629
Hey, Homer.

142
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:06,256
Shh! I'm more wanted
than the last petal

143
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:08,997
- on a bloomin' onion.
- Don't worry. You can stay with us.

144
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:10,928
I'm sure Marge will be cool.

145
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:32,404
I'm taking you to your home,
before you wreck mine!

146
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,575
You live here?

147
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:40,072
Bye, Marge.

148
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,133
Well, at least she's got a friend.

149
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:47,555
It's your turn to clean the toilet.

150
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,977
Where is it?

151
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,217
You're holding it.

152
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:56,009
Get in!

153
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:57,653
Oh, come on.

154
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:59,073
Thanks, Marge.

155
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,330
Gee, after all that's passed
between us, I mean...

156
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,519
Well, you're a bigger
woman than I am.

157
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,977
Are you calling me fat?

158
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:06,309
No, no, no!

159
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,836
I'll just be quiet.

160
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,722
Lurleen, this barbecue
is delicious!

161
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,904
Oh, it's a traditional
Southern recipe:

162
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:19,056
ketchup, Coca-Cola,
and fricasseed possum.

163
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:22,366
Just kiddin'.
It's actually chicken.

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,941
Well, I think it's wonderful.

165
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,988
My diet starts tomorrow!

166
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:30,452
Listen, I'm sorry I called you
all those mean things

167
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:32,903
like... oh, I don't
even remember.

168
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:35,120
- Confederate degenerate?
- Southern-fried succubus?

169
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,323
Hee-haw ho?

170
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:39,639
Oh, that's
all right, Marge.

171
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,377
I'm just so grateful
that y'all took me in

172
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:45,630
- and hid me from...
- Freeze, Patsy Crime!

173
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,920
- Chief, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

174
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,440
Why'd you jump off the roof?

175
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:55,723
I just wanted
to be extraordinary.

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,607
Your Honor, I would love to pay
the money I owe,

177
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,679
but country music changed,
and I went out of style.

178
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,621
Objection!
Speculating of trends in country music.

179
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:08,952
- of trends in country music.
- I'm going to allow it.

180
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:10,368
Lurleen,
the court orders you

181
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:12,508
to make payments
of a hundred dollars a week

182
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:15,202
till such time as your music
comes back in style

183
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,858
or becomes appreciated
for its camp value.

184
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,612
All right, what's the next case?

185
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:22,069
Judge, next we have a man

186
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,162
who is suing his wife
for not dressing sexy enough

187
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:27,947
in "The Case
of the Horny Husband."

188
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:29,052
What the...?

189
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,854
Well, I thought if we acted
like The People's Court,

190
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:34,084
some day we'd
beThe People's Court.

191
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:37,127
And, uh, well,
a bailiff can dream, can't he?

192
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:38,936
No, he can't.

193
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:41,403
I don't get it, Lurleen.
How did you lose all your money?

194
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,527
Did it go up your nose?
Between your toes?

195
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,962
Sadly, no.

196
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:47,093
Most of my money went
to my ex-husbands.

197
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:54,600
Boy, you sure have married
a lot of super-hunks.

198
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:55,724
Well, from now on,

199
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:58,183
the only thing I'm gonna be
married to is my work.

200
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:00,629
I've already accepted
"a high-octane job

201
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,821
in the nightlife industry."

202
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,800
All right, I need you to get the
rats outta the jukebox,

203
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,969
and clean the vomit out
of the pool table pockets,

204
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,528
and then you
got the job.

205
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:12,093
Oh, and you've gotta share
your tips with Manuel,

206
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:15,014
who's, uh, actually me
with a fake moustache.

207
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,588
Es good job.

208
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:18,014
You should take it.

209
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:20,995
Say, Lurleen,
are you Jamaican?

210
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,173
'Cause "Jamaican" me crazy.

211
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,878
That's sweet,
but I'm not lookin' to date.

212
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,216
No, I'm glad you said that.

213
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:29,889
'Cause you reminded me
that I'm not looking a David.

214
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,384
So... so great.

215
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:33,450
Hey, Lurleen, I'm going down
to the rock quarry tonight

216
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,896
to throw stones
at the woodchucks.

217
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:36,376
- Want to come?
- No.

218
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:37,928
That's okay.
I understand.

219
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:40,880
Someone's lookin'
at a snake in her mailbox.

220
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,567
She turned down
Lenny and Carl?

221
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:47,949
That's like someone who doesn't
like hamburgers or hot dogs.

222
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,343
What could make her
hate men like that?

223
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:56,121
o/~ I was cryin' in my cradle o/~

224
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,881
o/~ When my daddy hopped a train o/~

225
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:02,412
o/~ He left a hole in my heart

226
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,845
and filled it up with pain o/~

227
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:08,159
o/~ I know no amount of liquor

228
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:11,337
will soothe my achin' ticker o/~

229
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,080
o/~ 'Cause the love for my deadbeat daddy o/~

230
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:16,916
o/~ Is still pumpin' through my veins. o/~

231
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,913
So that's it.

232
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,474
She's been burned by
the most important

233
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,709
man in her life...
her father.

234
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:28,473
How could a man
just abandon his family?

235
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:29,934
By which I mean, what is the method

236
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,129
he would use,
and could anyone do it?

237
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,112
Where you going?

238
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,800
Lurleen Lumpkin has
a hole in her heart,

239
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,728
and I'm gonna fill it.

240
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:45,009
I've talked to over 500 men
named Lumpkin.

241
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,381
Everyone at Lumpkin, Lumpkin
and Rosenthal Associates,

242
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:52,388
an Asian or Pacific Islander
named Cho Lum Kin...

243
00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:54,593
Good luck
in searchings!

244
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:57,268
... but still no sign of Lurleen's dad!

245
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,402
Hello.

246
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,165
Are you Royce Lumpkin?

247
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,325
That's right.

248
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,718
The father
of Lurleen Lumpkin?

249
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,119
Lurleen?

250
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,411
I ain't seen my little girl
in 30 years.

251
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:14,354
She must be what, uh,
12, 13 by now?

252
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:17,633
She's 34,
and she's having a rough time!

253
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:19,420
Oh, man.

254
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,045
I better whiskey up
these corn flakes.

255
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:25,238
She needs to see you right away!

256
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,717
Oh, man.

257
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:29,384
I better heroin up
this orange juice.

258
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,079
There's only one man
who can hambone like that.

259
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:48,397
Daddy!

260
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:53,255
Lurleen?! My goodness.

261
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:56,503
Why, you're the spittin' image
of your mother's hotter sister!

262
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,234
Royce Lumpkin,
where you been?

263
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,744
I've been a dang fool. That's where.

264
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:05,172
Can you forgive me, Lurleen?

265
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:07,908
The way that I immediately
forgave myself?

266
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:16,256
I can, Daddy!

267
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:20,185
I made that hug happen!

268
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,112
Wait a minute. He's a deadbeat dad,

269
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:25,068
and yet, he's getting
as much love as me,

270
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,901
a dad too lazy to run away!

271
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,457
And he has hair! Oh!

272
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,196
Bart, get me my suicide axe.

273
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:36,124
No suicide axe!

274
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:38,127
Later.

275
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,535
You know what I like best
about this T-shirt?

276
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:48,630
I'll always be able to see
your face.

277
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,959
Oh, well, you don't

278
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,521
need a T-shirt
for that, Tootsie Pop,

279
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,905
'cause I ain't ever
gonna leave you again.

280
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:00,655
- Just sit still in my lap!
- What lap?

281
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:02,575
Yeah, all I see is
a gut with knees!

282
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:04,516
Why you little...

283
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:08,706
Get back here so we can put
our love on a shirt!

284
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:14,023
What?

285
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:16,452
Lurleen's daddy
comes back after 30 years,

286
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,573
and he's father of the year.
Why can't I leave for 30 years?

287
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:22,677
Fine with me.
Look, I packed you a bag.

288
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:25,626
- it might be cold outside.
- No problem. I bought you a hat.

289
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:28,796
Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology.

290
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:32,793
Well, in that case, I'm not going,
and I'm not staying.

291
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:35,202
And I'll cut my steak
with a spoon,

292
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:37,752
then take a walk
on the ceiling.

293
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:43,180
Oh, Daddy, you made me
the happiest girl

294
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,357
on whichever side of
the Mississippi this is.

295
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:48,576

Yeah, me, too.

317

re-abandoned her,

318
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:22,373
she's cut the word "pop"
out of all of our foods.

319
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,908
You'd think a house full
of crazy people would be fun.

320
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:32,726
It's actually really depressing.

321
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:41,037
Aw, cheer up.
You still got your talent,

322
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:44,558
and that new song you wrote
is gonna be a really big hit.

323
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,190
Here's a new song
that's rising faster

324
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:48,513
than a rocket
with a rocket up its butt.

325
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:50,958
It's from the Dixie Chicks!

326
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:57,709

just like my song,
but how could they have heard...?

333
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,093

340
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,175
Take it away, Royce!

341
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:52,934
He wrote this song!

342
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,257
Hey!

343
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:08,902
If you need me, I'll be...

344
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,823
Oh, who am I kidding?

345
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,953
No one needs me.

346
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:24,211
Colonel Homer!

347
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:26,254
And Major Marge!

348
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,847
- Well, I don't...
- Lurleen, you're giving

349
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:31,197
your dad too much power
over the way

350
00:18:31,198 --> 00:18:32,896
you feel about yourself.

351
00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:35,936
Stop getting your self-esteem
from the men in your life.

352
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:37,679
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

353
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,372
You're married to a
kind, thoughtful genius.

354
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:41,961
Uh, yeah...

355
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:45,118
Marge, my fringes
are knotted again.

356
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:48,057
There's only one
person in the world

357
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:50,106
who can tell you
what to do.

358
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:52,572
And that person
is right here!

359
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:54,181
Santa Claus?!

360
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:57,408
No, no, that's just our
old Christmas decorations.

361
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:01,196
- Me?!
- Yes!

362
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:04,820
It's time for you
to take control of your own destiny.

363
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:08,430
You're not a doormat.
You're a door prize!

364
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,062
You're right, Marge.

365
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:13,965
And remember, you can do anything
you want in the world of country music,

366
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:16,603
Western wear merchandising
and TV movies.

367
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:18,686
Regular movies...
don't hold your breath.

368
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:21,636
But TV movies...
the sky's the limit.

369
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:25,044
Colonel, you're still my knight
in white polyester.

370
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:26,864
Ten percent Lycra.

371
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,608
Oh, I noticed.

372
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,229
Congratulations!
That song I wrote you

373
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,711
was so patriotic,
they decided to make it

374
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:37,257
into a Chevy commercial,
so I, uh, changed a few lines.

375
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:40,537
I don't know.

376
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:43,350
You're asking us
to sell out our song. And for what?

377
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:44,932
Cash money.

378
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,692
- Money? Ooh, we love money!
- Really? That's great!

379
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,339
I'm gonna buy me
a clock radio!

380
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,755
you are a thief!

381
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,891
A dirty, rotten, lowdown...

382
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:59,035
I think I can say it
better with this.

383
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,884
No, no, no, don't
hit him in the head!

384
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:03,714
He needs that to
think up our songs.

385
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:07,601
I'm Lurleen Lumpkin,
and he stole your song from me!

386
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:08,849
What?!

387
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:13,532
Okay, maybe I abandoned
my daughter

388
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,572
and stole her song,
but I'm still the most

389
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,686
honorable record producer
y'all have ever met.

390
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,206
Well, he's got us there.

391
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:21,637
Still, in human terms,
he's deplorable.

392
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,074
Let's make guitar
picks out of him!

393
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,750
No!

394
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:28,052
I'm droppin' y'all
as clients!

395
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,283
Oh, I can't thank
you guys enough.

396
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:34,638
Now I'm opening
for the Dixie Chicks,

397
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:38,264
and I may have just met
husband #4.

398
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:40,519
Babe, need a hundred
bucks for beer.

399
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,298
Ooh, I think he's a keeper.

400
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,838
Well, you're very welcome, Lurleen.
Of all the women who've hit on Homer

401
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,491
over the years, you're my favorite.

402
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:55,298
If you ever come
near Homer again,

403
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:58,495
I'll strangle you
with your own hair extensions.

404
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,022
That's right. I know.

405
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:03,022
