1
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:08,677
The Simpsons S19E14
- Dial 'N' for Nerder -

2
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:32,511
Come and get me,
you syrupy stack of man-cakes.

3
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,259
It's too much work.

4
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,590
Why don't you come
and get me?

5
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:53,542
Jeez Louise, are you okay?

6
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:54,905
Just give me a minute.

7
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:57,819
Uh, but feel free to go nuts on me.

8
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,472
Oh, boy, dinner time!

9
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:08,670
The perfect break between work and drunk.

10
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:12,230
Wait. What's that smell?

11
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:14,360
It's like a stalk of broccoli

12
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,835
fell in a pot of boiling water.

13
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:20,258
It's your new diet!

14
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,270
But I have all those old diets
I still haven't finished.

15
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:26,830
Your lack of bedroom pizzazz
last night started me worrying,

16
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:29,730
so I hired this nutritionist,
Betsy Bidwell.

17
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:32,771
Homer, did you know I used to weigh 400 pounds?

18
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:35,102
I'll bet no man would touch you.

19
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:37,631
Well, I went from fat to "all that"

20
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:39,641
using my simple, foolproof diet.

21
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:41,931
It's all about little substitutions.

22
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,642
Instead of French toast for breakfast,

23
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,032
why not eat a bell pepper?

24
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:46,542
When you crave something sugary,

25
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:47,633
eat a bell pepper.

26
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:48,461
Want a beer?

27
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,393
Bell pepper!

28
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,402
It's tangy like a pepper,

29
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:55,950
but crunchy like a bell!

30
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:57,002
Bell pepper!

31
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,983
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs.

32
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,100
One, please.

33
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:05,540
Bell peppers... piping cold,
crunchy and bland.

34
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:06,541
Three, please.

35
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:34,482
Not quite.

36
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:36,533
Yeah. Get out.

37
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,691
You've gained seven pounds!

38
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:47,250
Well, they say muscle weighse than fat.

39
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,611
Homer, your body is all fat.

40
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:52,582
Homie, have you been
cheating on your diet?!

41
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:53,533
What?!

42
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:56,793
I'm not even gonna dignify
that with eye contact.

43
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:09,503
What you doin', Mom, goin' crazy?

44
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,083
Searching for evidence.

45
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:12,970
I know your father's cheating on his diet.

46
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:15,223
Hey, Marge, looking for something?

47
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:16,791
I'm looking for something, too...

48
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,600
a bell pepper I don't like.

49
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:21,081
Maybe it'll be this one.

50
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,333
Wrong again.

51
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,890
See that fat lady with the moustache?

52
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:31,513
That's you.

53
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:33,240
See that hippo rolling in dung?

54
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,251
You're the dung.

55
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,842
Now, that's enough. You each got one in.

56
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:38,663
Oh, but hers was better!

57
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:42,243
Meet Jennifer.

58
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,842
She's worried her acupuncturist boyfriend

59
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,201
is sticking it to someone else.

60
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,412
He used to be so loving.

61
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:51,772
Now he says he's always working late,

62
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:54,451
but when he comes home,
his needles aren't even bloody!

63
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:57,412
I've tried everything except talking to him.

64
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,283
Help me, TV show!

65
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,540
We'll find out if Jennifer's boyfriend

66
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:04,551
has been fooling around on Sneakers.

67
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,060
If you suspect a loved one
of cheating on you,

68
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,403
call the Sneakers hotline.

69
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:09,953
Also call if you don't suspect.

70
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:12,861
Most cheating happens when
you think everything is just great.

71
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:16,801
Hmm. Could this show help
me with eating cheating?

72
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,090
Out of the house, kids!

73
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:20,152
I have to make an adult phone call.

74
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:21,780
- Oh, man,not again...
- How would you...? Come on.

75
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:23,560
Go, go, go, go, go!

76
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:27,631
Springfields national park
Now smaller than ever

77
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:30,761
Hey, I didn't know this park was here.

78
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,823
You wrote a report on it last week.

79
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:33,921
The Internet wrote it.

80
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:35,280
I just handed it in.

81
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,802
Whoa, check that out!

82
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:41,173
Cool! The strong kicking the weak's butt.

83
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:42,980
It's disgusting!

84
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:46,963
Now you two play nice!

85
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:55,132
This is my husband.

86
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:58,200
I think he's been
sneakering on his diet.

87
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,122
I didn't used to mind it

88
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,931
when he'd lock the bathroom
door and snack off,

89
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,801
but when he's getting it regular,

90
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,732
night after night after night...

91
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:10,063
There, there.

92
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,142
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.

93
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:15,243
No, I mean,
cry to the camera over there.

94
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,470
There.

95
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:18,991
Yeah!

96
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:23,161
Hey, Martin, what are you doing?

97
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:25,260
Excavating for arrowheads!

98
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,712
Dude, it's Saturday.

99
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:28,950
- What kindof a freak wastes his...?
- May I join you?

100
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,512
Care to make ita trio, Bart?

101
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:32,532
You can brush, and I can blow!

102
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:34,502
Well, I agree you blow.

103
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:35,832
Then it's a plan.

104
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:38,573
A lot of people blow,
but no one blows like you.

105
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:40,161
High praiseindeed!

106
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,663
When you look up blow
in the dictionary...

107
00:05:41,665 --> 00:05:44,073
- Bart, he's not gonna get it!
- Fine.

108
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:56,503
The bone's the very thing,
methinks,

109
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:59,122
to prank my sister
and the dink.

110
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,543
Martin, I've made a major discovery!

111
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:10,481
A bone?!

112
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,081
It could be one of the major homos!

113
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:15,182
- You're one oft he major...
- Forget it.

114
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:30,043
- Martin!
- Oh, my God!

115
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:33,601
Grab on to this!

116
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:37,200
Come on, wake up!

117
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:46,833
Bart!

118
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:49,031
You can't just run
away from this!

119
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:51,251
You're right.

120
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,843
I can bike away much faster,

121
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,080
and ring the bell to drown out bad thoughts!

122
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:58,903
But Bart...

123
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:07,002
Bart, Martin could be
seriously hurt, or worse.

124
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,800
You're right.
We have to do something.

125
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:09,883
Let's watch TV!

126
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:14,653
<i>Happy, happy safe at home</i>

127
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,192
<i>Happy, happy...</i>

128
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:18,993
We interrupt Kaptain Kiddy's Komfort Karnival

129
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:21,903
to report on a grisly incident
involving a small child,

130
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:24,420
who has apparently
plunged off a guardrail here

131
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:25,971
at Springfield National Park.

132
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:28,050
According to this pocket protector,

133
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:30,803
the victim's name is Martin Prince.

134
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:34,073
Sadly, his pocket was protected,
but nothing else.

135
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,771
And we know exactly who is to blame.

136
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:38,201
No one.

137
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:40,123
The boy clearly fell by accident.

138
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:40,912
Huh?

139
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:43,430
He crashed through
the tree canopy there,

140
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:46,250
and was presumably eaten
by this cougar,

141
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:49,580
who is still coughing up
parts of the boy's clothes.

142
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:52,470
Tragic, just tragic.

143
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:54,440
You think this would fit little Ralphy?

144
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:55,730
Chief, that's evidence.

145
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:57,545
I know, but after it's evidence,

146
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,048
it's a shirt again, isn't it?

147
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,731
So Chief, what's your final word
on the Prince boy?

148
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:03,463
Hmm? Oh, dead. Definitely dead.

149
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:05,752
Uh, Chief, aren't we supposed to, uh,

150
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,201
notify the mily first?

151
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,942
What do you think I'm doing right now?

152
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:12,813
<i>Happy, happy, safe at home.</i>

153
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:14,860
- Oh, my God!
- We're murderers!

154
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,803
Hey, I was trying to help him.

155
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:18,910
At worst, I'm an accomplice.

156
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,521
I'm an accomplice!

157
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,103
Bookmobile.

158
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:33,061
Got any Joyce Carol Oates?

159
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:35,170
Nope. It's allDanielle Steel.

160
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:39,583
I've been in trouble, but never like this.

161
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,972
Guess I'll go turn myself in.

162
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,441
Uh, let's think about this.

163
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,150
Martin's gone, but it was an accident.

164
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,582
Ruining our lives
won't bring him back.

165
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:54,530
Lisa!

166
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,533
You're saying we shouldn't tell the truth?!

167
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,510
I'm saying this is worse than
a million A minuses!

168
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:01,372
So, how was your outside time?

169
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,153
We were never outside.
We were here all day.

170
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:06,003
That quick talking is never a good sign.

171
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,990
That's usually true,
but in this case, it's not.

172
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,521
Hmm. The kids are acting awfully strange.

173
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:14,182
Maybe I should sit down with them and...

174
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,220
- Homer, where are you going?!
- Work.

175
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,760
It's 4:00 o'clock on a Saturday.

176
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,180
I, uh,...

177
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,113
have to count the atoms
at the nuclear plant.

178
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,453
Conservation of mass.
It's the law.

179
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:33,110
The load is on the road.

180
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,663
This episode's gonna be great.

181
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:41,351
It'll finally win me
the respect of my father,

182
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,720
the Reverend Billy Graham, Junior.

183
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:00,430
Martin Prince was known

184
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:01,752
by many names...

185
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:04,983
Martin Priss, Martin Princess,
Fartin' Prince,

186
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:06,890
Martin the Brown-Nosed Reindeer...

187
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:07,963
That was mine.

188
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:10,040
Martin was a shy, awkward child

189
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:12,820
who will never fulfill his
promise to become

190
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:14,611
a weird, unloved adult.

191
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,681
The Audio-Visual Club
has prepared a video tribute

192
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,480
to their fallen associate.

193
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:34,200
<i>I will remember you</i>

194
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:41,100
<i>Will you remember me?</i>

195
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:46,383
<i>Don't let your life pass you by</i>

196
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,850
Jimbo, stop that.

197
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,930
Usually when I do

198
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:51,660
something bad, I feel good.

199
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:52,972
But not this time.

200
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:56,193
Martin was like Jesus, only real.

201
00:10:56,436 --> 00:11:00,091
Bart, keep it together.
People are looking.

202
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,571
I'm filled with rue.

203
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,023
You know, something bugs me.

204
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,222
Martin was afraid of heights.

205
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:07,860
What's he doing on a cliff?

206
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,050
It don't add up.

207
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,411
Hey, look who's trying to add.

208
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,901
You wuss.

209
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:26,212
The pig is in the sty.

210
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,982
You know, I used to make
documentaries about

211
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:33,020
coal miners, migrant workers,
things that mattered.

212
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,520
Yeah yeah, we're all whores.
Just get in there.

213
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:52,162
Into your hands, I commend this crap.

214
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,740
Well, enough burning ants.

215
00:12:06,745 --> 00:12:08,532
Time to investigate.

216
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,152
I now declare you chips and salsa.

217
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:34,671
Oh, hey, kids.

218
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,901
Um... what's up?

219
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:37,892
What do you mean "what's up"?

220
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,051
Why would something be up?

221
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:40,551
Yeah, nothing's up, nothing's down,

222
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,241
except for Martin, who died.

223
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,033
- Idiot!
- D'oh!

224
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:48,853
Well, I certainly wasn't eating

225
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:51,153
chips and salsa from this briefcase.

226
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:53,410
- What's up?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

227
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,041
Mmm, lamb.

228
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:53,641
Uh, I've never said this before,
but turn the camera off.

229
00:13:57,618 --> 00:14:00,752
- Hey, you little murderer.
- What?!

230
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,461
Those shades are killing me,

231
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:03,433
they're so cute.

232
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,573
Act like you're shopping.

233
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,250
We can't be seen together.

234
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:12,940
- But we're brother and sister.
- Exactly.

235
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:14,553
- Give me an lndian burn.
- But...

236
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,521
Don't make me say
"Indian" again.

237
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:19,733
Afternoon.

238
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:21,962
Doing a little shopping, huh?

239
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,693
Shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart.

240
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:26,932
I like how "Kwik" is spelled with a "K."

241
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:28,790
It's a quicker way
of spelling "quick. "

242
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:30,720
Well, you're busy people.

243
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:32,572
I'll let you get on with your day.

244
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:35,840
Oh, there is
one other thing.

245
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:38,313
I was up in Springfield National Park.

246
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:40,561
You know, where Martin bit the big one?

247
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:43,371
Found this bone tied to a string.

248
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:47,010
Almost like someone
was playing a prank on him.

249
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,190
You like pranks,
don't you, dingus?

250
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,420
I... like pranks.

251
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,910
Everyone likes pranks,
e- even Dr. Hibbert.

252
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,132
I hate pranks.

253
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:55,962
Well, better get going.

254
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:57,973
The missus is cooking
meat loaf tonight.

255
00:14:57,978 --> 00:14:59,861
My mom... Mrs. Muntz.

256
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,143
Bart, I have a plan.

257
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:08,412
We go to the morgue and
come back with a hand,

258
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:10,960
put its fingerprints
all over the railing...

259
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,690
Why are you being
so quiet, Bart?

260
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,250
Are you judging me?

261
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:17,122
Please don't judge me.

262
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:20,861
"I can't live with the guilt.

263
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,880
I'm going to Martin's house

264
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:24,782
to end it all"?!

265
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,030
Come on, pick up, pick up,

266
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,360
I know you're there.

267
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:36,240
Listen, baby,
the other night was great,

268
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:38,002
but it can never happen again.

269
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,042
Oh, who am I kidding?

270
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,323
I have to see you right now.

271
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:54,201
Bart, no, don't do...

272
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:56,751
whatever the heck you're doing.

273
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:59,103
I'm tending to Martin's
butterfly enclosure.

274
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:01,723
His butterflies are emerging
from their chrysalises tonight.

275
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,903
You said you wanted to end it all.

276
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:05,600
By which I meant bring Martin's

277
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,361
butterfly project to completion.

278
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,570
I can't take it anymore.

279
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:09,833
The stress is killing me.

280
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,042
I'm on a freight train
to Crazy Town.

281
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:14,293
- Çalm down.
- You calm down!

282
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,843
What was that?

283
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:23,013
The butterflies are hatching.

284
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:25,631
Aren't they beautiful?

285
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:28,220
<i>Greetings, my friends.</i>

286
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,062
<i>This beguiling lute solo</i>

287
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:34,351
<i>will ease your metamorphoses.</i>

288
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,533
Oh, it's a tape.

289
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:40,452
Martin must have set it to go off

290
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,042
when the chrysalises hatched.

291
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:45,143
Now, if I may mimic
your mother's feeding call...

292
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,960
Clawdy-claw,

293
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:49,662
clickety-cloo, clawdy-claw...

294
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:50,803
Thank you.

295
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:55,682
I thought I turned that tape off.

296
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,500
Maybe you just put
it on auto-reverse.

297
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:01,620
"Congratulations on purchasing
the Sanyo DL30,

298
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:04,343
the finest non-reversing
tape player"...

299
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:14,451
Here you go, hon-
one Butterscotch Stallion.

300
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:16,843
Homer Jay Simpson!

301
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:18,582
Pudding power, activate!

302
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:20,430
Oh, no, you don't.

303
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,353
Let him have it, Marge.

304
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,431
Sweetheart, I didn't want
to deceive you.

305
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,101
I just couldn't stand to see

306
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:28,411
the disappointment in your beautiful eyes.

307
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,283
That's it, Marge. Slap him good.

308
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,590
Zack, you're not trying
to help our marriage.

309
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:39,810
You're trying to split us up.

310
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:43,611
I'd rather have a chubby
hubby than a sexy exy.

311
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:46,313
Aw, Marge, if there was a reality show

312
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,073
called Fat Guys Who Really Love Their Wives,

313
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:52,131
that not only would it be an
enormous ratings success,

314
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,370
but I'd be the first one on it.

315
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:58,150
Marge, you've given me a lot

316
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:59,271
to think about today.

317
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:00,700
Now, if you'll excuse me,

318
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:02,082
I'm going to the editing room

319
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,212
to make you look insane.

320
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,801
To the post-production trailer!

321
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,750
Where is this music coming from?

322
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,372
Get off me!

323
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,880
His foot is caught in my button hole.

324
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:34,431
I almost flicked an innocent butterfly.

325
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:37,521
Bart, we're turning into monsters.

326
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:39,922
- Cool.
- No, not cool.

327
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,902
We have to do the right thing
and come clean.

328
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:47,011
Listen, world,
we killed Martin Prince!

329
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:49,802
That's all I needed to hear.

330
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,263
You almost got away with it,

331
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,923
but here's where you got sloppy:

332
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:54,911
shouting out that you did it.

333
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,691
Oh, man, I'm too pretty to go to jail.

334
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,841
You don't know how lucky you are.

335
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,043
I'm just glad it was you

336
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:04,800
who brought us in, Nelson.

337
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:06,710
Remember when we used to date?

338
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:07,720
If you let me go,

339
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:09,190
we can get back together.

340
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,903
I never let you cherry-bomb

341
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:11,911
my Malibu Stacy.

342
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,231
I'll let you do it now.

343
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,562
Save it for the warden.

344
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:16,163
Please, keep it down

345
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,760
around the newborns.

346
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,333
To quote Mark Twain,
"rumors of my death

347
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:23,621
have been greatly exaggerated. "

348
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:25,641
Yeah, and rumors of your wussiness

349
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:27,171
are a hundred percent true.

350
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:28,842
Now tell us how you survived the fall.

351
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:30,551
For years I've worn underwear

352
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,833
with a wedgie-accommodating waistband.

353
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:34,752
On that fateful day,

354
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:38,211
these mighty whiteys saved my life.

355
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:44,643
<i>Malheureusement, I landed</i>

356
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:47,122
<i>right next to a cougar's lair.</i>

357
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:48,993
<i>He saw me as easy prey.</i>

358
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:52,283
<i>I feared death was a certainty</i>

359
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:53,862
<i>until I was saved</i>

360
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,290
<i>by simple physics.</i>

361
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,412
<i>I landed on a small isle</i>

362
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,073
<i>in the middle of a murky lake.</i>

363
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,713
<i>I spent an hour fashioning an escape raft</i>

364
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:06,873
<i>and three days crafting</i>

365
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,440
<i>this modesty skirt.</i>

366
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,181
Well, it's good to have

367
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,541
you alive, Dorkburger,

368
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:15,900
and as for you two,

369
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:17,150
I hope you learned your lesson.

370
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:19,611
I learned that beneath my goody two-shoes

371
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,310
lie some very dark socks.

372
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:24,510
And I learned that killing a nerd

373
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:26,313
is not as fun as it sounds.

374
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:31,143
There is just one more thing.

375
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,292
You folks have a good night now.




9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
