1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,772
The Simpsons S19E15 (KABF08)
- Smoke on the Daughter -

2
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:43,346
Bart, it's me!

3
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:48,731
I'm Lord Evilton from
the Angelica Button books.

4
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:51,090
The last book in
the series goes on sale

5
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,498
at midnight and we're going
to go stand in line.

6
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:55,926
Wait in line for a book?!

7
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:58,271
- You tell 'em Bart says hey.
- Come on, boy.

8
00:00:58,272 --> 00:00:59,713
All the nerds are doing it.

9
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:03,043
I'm not a nerd.
I'm a jock who's too cool for sports.

10
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:06,830
- It's the final book!
- I wonder what happens?

11
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,077
Maybe the Sandrux is the Narcolops.

12
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:11,376
I read a rumor Spider-man's in it.

13
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,316
Shut up! Shut up!

14
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,362
This is a spoiler-free zone.

15
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,630
Nice Angelica Button costume, Lisa.

16
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:22,280
Although...

17
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:25,461
the gryphon on your coat
of arms is facing left not right.

18
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:28,853
And FYI, Angelica wears
two tortoise shell barrs.

19
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,042
Nice try, though.

20
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,753
I based my costume on the books,
not the movies.

21
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:42,842
Okay, I'm going to hand
out colored bracelets.

22
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:44,730
The color on your bracelet
will determine...

23
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:45,873
Move or die!

24
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:51,623
It's for my kid!

25
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:52,882
Eureka!

26
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:57,162
Now read it to me!

27
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:00,933
"The Dark Lord has summoned you"
said the withered troll.

28
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:03,341
Do the character voices!

29
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:06,143
"And bring your cloak.

30
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:09,920
The torture room can be
frightfully chilly."

31
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,163
Angelica's first kiss, da-da-da.

32
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:13,963
Subplot about her cat, who cares?

33
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:17,541
Professor Skizzletwitch is a Were-bear,
and, uh, no, no, he's not.

34
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:20,651
Maluicious Krubb is actually
Kraluicious Mubb.

35
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,901
All is lost, Angelica uses the spell
she learned in chapter six.

36
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,261
Magic, magic, magic,
all is won.

37
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:33,492
Well, that's our book for the year.

38
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:35,552
I think we've earned some TV.

39
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,063
TV! TV! TV!

40
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:40,543
But kids, I want you in bed by 3:00 a.m.

41
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:42,890
Hey, somebody's got to be the bad guy.

42
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,060
But I don't understand,
how could he have murdered his wife

43
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:49,013
if he was making
a phone call 3,000 miles away?

44
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:50,943
Well, maybe he reached out done

45
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:52,902
and killed someone.

46
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,263
I saw this.
He trained his dog to do it.

47
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:04,710
Up next,
which former Friends star

48
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:07,502
is speaking out against
adult illiteracy?

49
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:09,093
It's Lisa Kudrow.

50
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:11,790
Stop saying things, Bart.

51
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:13,341
That's the TV's job.

52
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:16,093
And the First Lady
has agreed

53
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,472
to sit on the egg
until it hatches.

54
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:19,503
More after this.

55
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:23,983
See that?
That's talent.

56
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,530
You think you got it?
You don't.

57
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:28,400
'Cause only I can teach it and
I ain't taught you, so you don't

58
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:31,600
The Chazz Busby Ballet Academy
is coming to Springfield.

59
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:32,952
Auditions are Monday.

60
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,062
Callbacks are Tuesday.

61
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:36,020
Wednesday,
you see I'm a heartless bastard.

62
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,853
Thursday you realize
you love me, damn it.

63
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:39,150
Friday, we're closed.

64
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:40,261
You're fired.

65
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:40,952
You're her.

66
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:42,232
Jump, dance, love.

67
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:45,591
A ballet academy here
in Springfield?

68
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:46,773
Move over, Europe!

69
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,861
I didn't know you cared
about ballet.

70
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:52,502
Lisa, have I ever shown you
my Shattered Dreams Box?

71
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:53,271
No.

72
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,710
It's upstairs in
my Disappointment Closet.

73
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:59,450
There were so many things I wanted to

74
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:02,163
do in life that I never got
a chance to do:

75
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,401
doctor, safecracker,

76
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:06,712
stethoscope sales lady.

77
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,442
None came to pass.

78
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:10,643
But the thing I really wanted to be,

79
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:12,393
ever since I was little,

80
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,390
was a ballerina.

81
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:15,500
So what happened?

82
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:18,072
My bosoms came in
and ruined my balance.

83
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:19,472
Really? How?

84
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:21,203
They came in one at a time.

85
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,591
- Oh... do you think mine...?
- No.

86
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,440
I'm pretty sure you'll have
your dad's boobs.

87
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:32,540
Mom, it's not too late
to un-shatter your dream.

88
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:35,123
Martha Graham danced
well into her 70s.

89
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:38,052
You mean she danced well,
into her 70s?

90
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:40,540
Or she danced,
well into her 70s?

91
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,320
Well, she danced into her 70s.

92
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,211
I think you've got a point.

93
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,663
Homie, I'm gonna be a dancer!

94
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:47,780
Go-go or boring?

95
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:49,560
- Boring!
- Oh...

96
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:56,081
Okay, ladies, listen up:

97
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,123
Forget everything you've
ever learned about ballet...

98
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:58,853
good.

99
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:00,521
Now, from Bolshoi Fifth Position,

100
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:01,873
give me a Battement Glisse,

101
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:04,330
a Double Changement,
two Swan Lake Fouettï¿½s,

102
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,192
then finish with
a Grand Pas De Chat.

103
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,513
Now show me what you got, uh...

104
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,660
Simpson, comma, Marge.

105
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:28,783
I haven't seen dancing like that since
my Broadway show Dancing Like That.

106
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:29,610
Closed in a week.

107
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:31,020
Too smart for the corndog crowd,

108
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,451
too dumb for the bagel bunch.

109
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:33,291
You keep it up, kid.

110
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,360
You got something.

111
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:38,992
Son, while your mother and
little mother are out,

112
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:42,553
I'm gonna let you in on a deep,
dark family secret.

113
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:43,843
You have a drinking problem?

114
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:45,913
I said secret.

115
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:50,230
Have you ever wondered what
I do in that locked room?

116
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:51,243
Gay out?

117
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,633
Well, wonder no more!

118
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,121
Beef jerky!

119
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:59,022
The queen of all the jerkys!

120
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,252
That's right.

121
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:02,321
Now, I'll cut and you soak.

122
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:09,120
Dad, marinating with you is cool.

123
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,902
Thanks, son.

124
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:14,560
Some of that is cow blood.

125
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:19,720
Look, Lise!
I'm as supple as ever!

126
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:23,772
It won't go down.

127
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:29,780
Marge, Marge, Marge...

128
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,800
you know what they say,
those who cannot do...

129
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,943
- Teach?
- No, they go home.

130
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:35,552
How can they teach if they can't do?

131
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:36,800
Get out!

132
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:42,181
You can't talk to my mom like that.

133
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:43,190
Who the hell...

134
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:44,992
taught you to stand like that?

135
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,392
This is how I always stand

136
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,541
when I tell adults what
they should be doing.

137
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,430
You have naturally perfect posture.

138
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:52,853
I rarely say this, but,
how would you like to become

139
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,203
to a paying student at my dance academy?

140
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,272
Uh, I don't know, I...

141
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:58,732
We accept!

142
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:10,500
I'm sorry, I got confused.

143
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:11,990
You don't get to be "confused."

144
00:07:12,004 --> 00:07:14,407
Not till you've won six Tonys,
gone into rehab,

145
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:16,446
married your plastic surgeon, retired,

146
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:19,646
and then un-retired in a special little
show called Woman of the Year...

147
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,190
you can't, uh...

148
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:23,071
Hey, I forget where I'm going with this.

149
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,452
Take a break, people.

150
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,710
Eh, eh, eh, en pointe!

151
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:32,293
This is so hard.

152
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:33,120
Get used to it.

153
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,992
We balerinas are under constant
pressure to stay focused,

154
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:38,350
skinny, graceful and skinny.

155
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,581
How do you cope with it?

156
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:41,120
You find out what works you.

157
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,682
For some people it might be yoga,

158
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:44,181
for others, meditation.

159
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:47,842
But for every ballerina in the world,
it's cigarettes.

160
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:52,373
Cigarettes?!

161
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,872
They can kill you.

162
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:55,401
They did a whole episode about it on

163
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:56,970
The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.

164
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,093
Zack tried to impress a girl by smoking,

165
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:01,261
but she went for Cody instead.

166
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,523
Zack's life wasn't so sweet then.

167
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,890
If God didn't want ballerinas to smoke,

168
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:07,420
how come I can do this?

169
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:15,681
No!

170
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:17,001
All I need to stay focused

171
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:19,101
is good old-fashioned fresh air.

172
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:21,903
Nothing like fresh air.

173
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:26,193
Fresh air.

174
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:33,132
Horrible, horrible, horrible...

175
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,960
no longer describes
your dancing, Lisa.

176
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,201
You're good, kid!

177
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:41,281
I've gotten better since this morning.

178
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:42,741
How could that have happened?

179
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:46,170
Maybe it's all the secondhand
"focus" and "pep" you are inhaling.

180
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:51,442
They don't call these
"dancer sticks" for nothin'.

181
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,610
I thought they were cancer sticks.

182
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:57,311
I dan't dear dou!

183
00:08:57,316 --> 00:09:00,491
My Hindu friend,
this is a chance for your Kwik-E-Mart to

184
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:04,043
get in on the ground floor of
a delicious new taste sensation.

185
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,473
You talk a good game,

186
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:07,390
but do you have
the product to back it up?

187
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:09,931
Step into our Jerkatorium.

188
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:12,832
What the...!

189
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,063
Where's our jerky?

190
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:15,761
You have wasted my time!

191
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:19,041
You have made
a very powerless enemy.

192
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,650
Good day and be well!

193
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:21,642
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

194
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:24,292
You haven't seen our
PowerPoint presentation...

195
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,143
Bart?

196
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:29,272
"J," just the product you need.

197
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,533
"E," excellent value.

198
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,673
"R," retailer's dream.

199
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:34,490
"K..."

200
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:36,590
You can skip the "K" and the "Y."

201
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:40,470
I do not thank you
and I will not come again.

202
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:44,471
Who could have done this?

203
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:46,881
Well, something chewed
through the cellar door

204
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,921
and the floor is covered
with paw prints...

205
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:51,150
is can only mean one thing:

206
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,922
Flanders, you ate my jerky!

207
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:56,082
As the oak said to the beagle,
you're barkin' up the wrong tree.

208
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:58,323
I spent the whole morning
blacking out the "goshes"

209
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,051
and "darns" in these Hardy Boys books.

210
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,030
I know you ate my jerky

211
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:05,972
just like I ate
your earthquake supplies.

212
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:07,953
Dad, look!
Raccoons!

213
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,841
You stay right here.

214
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,251
Okily dokily!

215
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,591
Ah! "heck, darn."

216
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:19,430
I don't think so.

217
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:23,660
Lisa...

218
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,061
Lisa Simpson...

219
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,083
Time for a smoke.

220
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:32,361
Look, everyone knows that
cigarettes are where flavor lives

221
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,070
and a cool choice for a hot night.

222
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:35,831
But they're for losers!

223
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:37,052
Losers?

224
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,373
You mean losers like...

225
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:41,420
Simone de Beauvoir, Margaret Mead,

226
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:44,553
Queen Elizabeth I, Lauren Bacall...

227
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:46,890
My feminist heroes!

228
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:49,401
Don't forget me
Lillian Hellman!

229
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:54,222
Smoking gave me the energy I needed
to write plays and inventiveness!

230
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:57,363
Bring out the Hellman's,
and bring out the best.

231
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:58,803
Puff with us!

232
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:00,531
Puff with us!

233
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:02,691
Puff with us!

234
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:16,123
Yeah, that's it,
don't be shy.

235
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:19,560
Enjoy your jerky laced
with sleeping pills.

236
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:22,072
Nobody outwits Homer Simpson.

237
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,813
Hey, they're not sleepy.

238
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,442
Just turning fuzzy.

239
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:30,481
Homer, you ate their jerky.

240
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,221
I thought this might happen,

241
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:35,823
so I brought the best weapon
to operate while drugged:

242
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,760
a crossbow.

243
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,271
No!

244
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:02,151
Chazz Busby says
you're really making progress!

245
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,852
Do you need more leg warmers?

246
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:05,812
No, stop buying me leg warmers!

247
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,711
I'm already wearing six pairs!

248
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:10,322
Well, the important thing is,
someday,

249
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:12,530
I'll be watching my little Marge

250
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:14,330
dancing at Lincoln Center.

251
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,960
Lisa, Mom. I'm Lisa.

252
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,960
Of course, you're Lisa.

253
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:21,401
Lisa the dancing Marge girl.

254
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,223
Dad, you never win a

255
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:24,670
fight with animals.

256
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:26,612
Remember when you lost
that war with the worms?

257
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:27,912
That wasn't a defeat,

258
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,583
it was a phased withdrawal.

259
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:32,421
Oh, yeah?
They made you build this statue.

260
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,192
When you cut 'em, they multiply.

261
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,630
I can't fight that!

262
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,971
Now, let's take care
of those raccoons.

263
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:49,762
Aw, they're using the jerky
to feed their family.

264
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:52,033
Look, there's a Homer and a Bart

265
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:53,652
and a Marge and a Lisa.

266
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,430
Aw, they even share
my views on parenting!

267
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,391
Enjoy your jerky,
little critters,

268
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,771
and, one day, you'll
grow up to be people.

269
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,433
Bart, get some more jerky

270
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:06,150
for man's new best friend.

271
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,660
When's our next break?

272
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:18,671
When the big cigarette hits 9.

273
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,932
All right, that was pretty good

274
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,973
for uncoordinated hippopotamuses.

275
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:25,132
Hit the river, ladies.

276
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:26,392
Go ahead, have a wallow.

277
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,511
What am I doing?

278
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,420
I don't need second hand
smoke to do ballet...

279
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:43,020
I need firsthand smoke!

280
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:48,131
Lisa!

281
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:49,051
Give me that!

282
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:58,001
I can't believe how easy it is

283
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,381
in this country
to get cigarettes.

284
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:04,431
I can't believe you
were smoking.

285
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,511
Did you know the "sturgeon" general

286
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,172
said you're not supposed to?

287
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:10,093
A "sturgeon" is a fish.

288
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:13,001
And a very wise fish he is!

289
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:17,141
Marge, I'm taking Lisa out
of that stupid...

290
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,010
What the...?

291
00:14:20,395 --> 00:14:21,671
Oh, Homie,

292
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:23,933
I've been so happy lately.

293
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,472
I'm completely fulfilled,

294
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:28,442
both as a mother and
a fan of youth ballet!

295
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:30,840
Now what did you want
to say to me?

296
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,550
Are you sure you want
Lisa to keep dancing?

297
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:35,542
There's nothing that makes
a mother's heart

298
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:38,510
soar more than seeing
child take wing.

299
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:41,062
Look at me, I'm glowing!

300
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:42,101
Maybe you're drunk.

301
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,021
Homie, Lisa's dancing has made

302
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:47,443
me really, really, happy.

303
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:52,692
Okay.

304
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,542
Oh, fatherhood hurts my brain.

305
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:57,071
Dad!

306
00:14:57,656 --> 00:14:59,210
Dad, a little help?

307
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,770
You're on your own.

308
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:06,091
Because it means so much
to your mother,

309
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:07,523
you can keep doing ballet.

310
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,391
But you have to stop smoking,

311
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:10,851
including secondhand!

312
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:12,122
That's easy for you to say.

313
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:14,783
You've never had
to be thin and focused.

314
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:15,992
What'd you say?

315
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,752
I'm just saying it's gonna be hard
for me to quit,

316
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,851
especially before the recital.

317
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:22,771
I thought you might have
trouble with this.

318
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:25,900
That's why I'm assigning someone
to keep watch over you.

319
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,952
Someone you'd never expect.

320
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,200
- Is it Bart?
- D'oh!

321
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:30,360
Come on out, boy.

322
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:34,850
For the next three days,

323
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:38,003
I'm gonna stick to you like
waffle syrup on a shag rug.

324
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:39,972
I'm gonna be on you like fish stink

325
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:41,091
on a Gloucester dog.

326
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:42,881
I'm gonna be all over you like...

327
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:44,500
where'd she go?

328
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,901
Okay, everybody!
Dress rehearsal!

329
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:59,082
Hey, I'm still paying
for that nose!

330
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:00,363
Lisa, the last time I checked,

331
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:01,763
this was not Worldwide Wrestling.

332
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,310
And I checked five minutes ago.

333
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:10,503
Hey Lisa, come on over.

334
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:13,143
I can't... I promised I wouldn't.

335
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:14,413
If you don't breathe it,

336
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,672
that smoke might go
into a baby.

337
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:19,333
Well, since you cared enough

338
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:21,143
to apply peer pressure...

339
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:24,410
There you go. Awesome.
You go, girl.

340
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,422
Much better.
That's it, yeah.

341
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:38,922
Yello.

342
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,483
She what?!

343
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:41,880
Oh, my God!

344
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:43,921
Well, I'm going to settle
this once and for all!

345
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:46,092
Meet me at
the place we discussed.

346
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:48,010
- Who was that?
- Wrong number.

347
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,411
Five min ladies.

348
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,511
Okay, Bart, it's time
for Operation:

349
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:03,822
Crazy-Plan.

350
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:06,063
Step one: we chuck
the raccoon in there.

351
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,211
What if someone catches him?

352
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:07,872
Don't worry.

353
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,840
I have a perfect way
to conceal his identity.

354
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,673
Okay, now go, boy!

355
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:35,292
Not keys, cigarettes!

356
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:41,061
Yeah, that's what I mean.

357
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:48,011
Okay, now we get rid
of the cigarettes.

358
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:50,363
Lord, I could use a smoke.

359
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,551
Thank god.

360
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,992
Cigarette?

361
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:56,822
Can't. I'm pregnant.

362
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:58,723
Uh, one more favor?

363
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:08,071
Wow, what a great first act.

364
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,080
I hope Sleeping Beauty

365
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:11,452
never wakes up.

366
00:18:11,497 --> 00:18:14,663
Good, that's so hot.
Good job. Great.

367
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:16,970
My cigarettes!

368
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:18,362
What happened
to my cigarettes?!

369
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:21,712
Found one!

370
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:23,152
That's your finger!

371
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:24,562
I don't care!

372
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,862
Watch your hoof,
you blue-ribbon sow.

373
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:48,372
I'll spit on your grave,
grandma!

374
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,051
Oh, no!
My appetite's coming back!

375
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,381
I haven't seen crap like this

376
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:00,703
since my Broadway show:

377
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,601
Crap Like This.

378
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,911
Ran for five years.

379
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,580
We can smoke the programs!

380
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,542
I can smoke my hair!

381
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:15,742
Maybe there's gum
under the seats!

382
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,361
All right, that's enough!

383
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,260
I want to talk about
a horrible practice

384
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,341
afflicting millions of Americans.

385
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:26,822
For years we've known
how dangerous it is.

386
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,232
It stunts your growth.

387
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:30,373
And it's marketed
to children.

388
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:32,573
I'm talking about ballet.

389
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:33,993
I'll smoke to that!

390
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,171
Ballet is unnatural and
unfair to women.

391
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,632
I shall now cast off the shoes

392
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,781
of oppression!

393
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,373
You'll never take down
big ballet!

394
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,613
Never!
Now good day!

395
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:08,433
This is my favorite family tradition...

396
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:11,072
ice cream after
a botched recital.

397
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,272
And I'm happy
to be smoke-free,

398
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,551
thanks to these children's
nicotine patches.

399
00:20:15,577 --> 00:20:19,403
And I realize it's wrong to
try to live your career dreams

400
00:20:19,408 --> 00:20:20,740
through your children.

401
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:22,141
Does that mean I can stop training

402
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:23,161
to be a Mexican wrestler?

403
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,212
No!

404
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:28,090
Now practice preening
to the crowd, El Guapo.

405
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:33,733
Come on, preen harder!

406
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:35,492
Make them hate you!

407
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:38,831
You feed on their hatred and
you are so hungry!

408
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,022
