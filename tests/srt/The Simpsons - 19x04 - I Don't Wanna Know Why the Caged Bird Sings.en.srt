1
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:17,623
I am not an Fdic-insured bank.

2
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,084
Wow, Bart!

3
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:06,783
Lookin' good!

4
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:09,428
Well, I have to look
good for tomorrow.

5
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:10,274
Right...

6
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,941
tomorrow.

7
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:14,766
Homer, you do know
what tomorrow is.

8
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:15,727
Think. Think.

9
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:17,354
I'm not thinking. You think.

10
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,020
You have to think,
it's your job!

11
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,749
You have to think,
it's your job.

12
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:22,019
Why you little...

13
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,184
Homer!

14
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,820
Lisa is receiving

15
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:29,421
the Student of
the Millennium

16
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:30,721
Award at school.

17
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,263
To be fair,
the millennium

18
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:33,971
just started,
so it's not

19
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:35,580
that big a deal.

20
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:37,292
But they're giving it to me.

21
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:39,912
You have to be there.

22
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:41,542
You miss way too
many precious

23
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:43,211
moments in
the childrens' lives.

24
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,413
What?! Name 12.

25
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:46,571
Well, just this week,

26
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:47,653
there's been field day,

27
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:48,893
picking me up from
the airport...

28
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,791
And the Father-Daughter Dance.

29
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:54,780
Lisa, if you like,
I'm certified

30
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:57,153
to conduct a mock father
daughter conversation.

31
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:58,443
Just dance.

32
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,690
Homer, you cannot
miss Lisa's big day.

33
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:03,043
And you have to
come sober!

34
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:05,022
American sober or Irish sober?

35
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:06,680
Point zero eight sober.

36
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:07,900
Point one five.

37
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,091
Point zero nine.

38
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,761
Point one zero with a

39
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:11,720
stomach full of bread.

40
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:12,703
My final offer.

41
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:14,270
Deal.

42
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,413
Goodnight, sweetheart.

43
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:27,883
Can't be late
for Lisa's big day.

44
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,961
I'm gonna make it.

45
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:50,011
I'll be on time
for Lisa's thing.

46
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:52,593
Ooh, an awesome accident.

47
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:53,852
Easy, easy...

48
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:56,690
I'll just take three
seconds to gawk.

49
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:58,900
Aw, everyone's okay.

50
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:01,991
Gonna make it.
Gonna make it.

51
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:10,290
An hour and 54 minutes to spare.

52
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:12,061
With my free time I can finally

53
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,031
work on my Superman novel.

54
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:15,971
"'Make way for Superman,'

55
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,641
"said Superman as he punched

56
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:19,581
everyone at the Coffee Bean.

57
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:21,020
Chapter Two..."

58
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:26,053
Oh, man,

59
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,662
they just keep
kicking off awards

60
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,572
season earlier and earlier.

61
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,420
Yeah, the whole thing
is just a scam

62
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:33,881
to sell ad space
in the school paper.

63
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:37,142
That's the place that
did both my Grandmas.

64
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:39,322
I did both your grandmas.

65
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:40,382
Shut up!

66
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:42,271
Shall we look
at the next one?

67
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:43,371
Willie.

68
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:44,743
He'll buy beer for you,
but he'll make

69
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,022
you drink it with him.

70
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:55,722
Darn these long bank lines.

71
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:57,032
Although it does give me

72
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,862
a moment with my thoughts.

73
00:03:58,865 --> 00:03:59,842
Ooh...

74
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:02,620
Darn these long bank lines.

75
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:11,182
That old man over
there isn't even

76
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,870
making a transaction.

77
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,871
He just wants
someone to talk to.

78
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:17,050
Before this was
the Bank of Springfield,

79
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,390
this was the Midwest
Savings and Loan.

80
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:20,592
And before that,

81
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:22,492
it was an abandoned theater.

82
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,851
And before that,
it was a theater.

83
00:04:24,877 --> 00:04:27,113
Where's Dr. Kevorkian
when you need him?

84
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:28,922
Well, if I know doctors,

85
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:30,750
he's probably golfing.

86
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:33,660
Excuse me for
a moment.

87
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,681
Everyone down
on the floor, now!

88
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,082
This is a robbery!

89
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:43,762
Uh, not a separate
robbery we're together.

90
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,290
You mean like a couple?

91
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:46,382
- No!
- Yes!

92
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,270
Oh, great.

93
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:51,481
We're being robbed by
Johnny and Clyde!

94
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:58,112
Stay away from
that button!

95
00:04:58,998 --> 00:04:59,961
Damn it!

96
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:07,090
Well, Marge,

97
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,583
who's the unfit parent now?

98
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,321
You know, a principal's dream

99
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,182
would be to have a school with

100
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:16,121
nothing but Lisa Simpsons.

101
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:18,563
Unfortunately, the rest of you exist.

102
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,883
From her grade-grubbing
to her apple polishing...

103
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,011
She's got a cell phone!

104
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:28,393
We didn't plan for this, man.

105
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:29,660
We didn't plan for this.

106
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:33,262
Ol' Gil's here for his first

107
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,832
day as security guard.

108
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:35,512
Oh, boy...

109
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:40,982
Oh, no. Now it's murder, man.

110
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:42,040
It's murder.

111
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:48,322
Uh, Chief, looks like
we gota 64-G in progress.

112
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:51,912
Armed robbery with a gun.

113
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:58,553
Come on, Chief, you know this.

114
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:00,570
Oh, a shooty-stealy.

115
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,613
And now the reason
we're all here today...

116
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,162
Lisa Simpson!

117
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:16,460
Oh, hello, Marge.

118
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,112
I'm at the most important event

119
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:19,281
of our daughter's life,

120
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,222
and you're totally late.

121
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:22,482
Am I disappointed?

122
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:23,183
Yes.

123
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,541
Am I surprised?

124
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:25,252
No.

125
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,181
Homer.

126
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:29,121
I'm a hostage in
a bank robbery.

127
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:29,771
What?!

128
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:31,772
Oh, my God,
my sweet Margie!

129
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:33,741
Okay, listen very carefully.

130
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,612
Don't do anything they say,

131
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:37,412
remain panicky, and above all,

132
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:38,411
try to be a hero.

133
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:39,840
Homer, I have to go.

134
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,000
If I don't make it,

135
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:42,621
feel free to remarry

136
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,980
from anyone on the list in

137
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,501
the bulletin board in the closet.

138
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:48,113
Lindsat Naegle, Booberella,
Blythe Danner. Also, feed cat

139
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:52,092
Good-bye, my love!

140
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:56,541
Okay,

141
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,162
this isn't the way
I planned it,

142
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,753
but you can make it out alive

143
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:01,230
as long as there's no funny stuff.

144
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:02,599
Don't worry about me.

145
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:05,419
I was voted America's
least funny clown.

146
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,484
Worse than Scuzzo, Scummo,
Oopsie, Carlos Mencia,

147
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:09,491
Stinko, Blumpy.

148
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,302
Even worse Sergeant Serious!

149
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,673
How could I do worse than him?!

150
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,232
I stole all his jokes!

151
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,551
Chief, you gotta do something

152
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:21,402
my current wife is in there!

153
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,772
Maybe you should take over,

154
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:24,302
cause I got no stake in this.

155
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:25,492
This isn't even my bank.

156
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:27,020
I'm over at First Federal.

157
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh! Dye pack!

158
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,772
Man, that stings.

159
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,651
Oh. Damn it!

160
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:39,211
What are you looking at, huh?

161
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:44,570
Oh! Is anyone else a dye pack?

162
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,343
Tell me now,
and I won't shoot you.

163
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:47,803
I... Ooh!

164
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:50,482
You said diabetic, right?

165
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:56,251
Finally, the help we need

166
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:58,313
a DVD of The Negotiator.

167
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:03,003
Which chapter should we skip to?

168
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:05,380
"Meet Danny Ron",
"rouble Brewing,"

169
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:07,810
"Off the Case",
"My Baby's in There,"

00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:10,550
"Enter Niebaum,""Take the Shot,"

171
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:13,183
"Sabian's Choice,""Check and Mate,"

172
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:16,193
"Friends At Last,""Closing Credits"?

173
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,492
Oh, man, oh, man.

174
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,463
What the hell's taking them so long?

175
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:20,882
They must be getting ready to kill me!

176
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:22,030
It's no fair.

177
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:23,310
I shouldn't die.

178
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:25,560
I just came here to check the date!

179
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:32,293
Dwight, use your noodle.

180
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:33,860
If you surrender now,

181
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:36,473
you're only lookingat a few years in jail.

182
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,143
I'll tell them you're a good guy.

183
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:40,290
Marge, I can't go back to prison.

184
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,933
I've got no wife,
I've got no family.

185
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:44,231
I've got nothing!

186
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,053
If I give my self up,

187
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,901
will you come visit
me in the joint?

188
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,841
Hey, if I can say yes

189
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:02,083
to Chinese toys that kill kids,

190
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:04,220
you can say yes to him.

191
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:07,791
Okay, I'll visit you, Dwight.

192
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:17,980
Oh, Marge,

193
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:20,611
I was afraid I was going to lose you!

194
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,742
Now let me help you make your

195
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:26,333
slow transition back to society.

196
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,371
I just want to go home.

197
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,401
You have a new home now with us.

198
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,880
See ya soon, Marge.
Real soon!

199
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:37,062
Just like you promised!

200
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:47,982
Sweetheart,what's wrong?

201
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,871
I promised that bank robber

202
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,521
that I'd visit him in jail,

203
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:53,193
but I just can't do it.

204
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:54,663
You don't owe him anything.

205
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,341
Moe was in the hospital for three weeks,

206
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,830
and I didn't visit him once.

207
00:09:57,846 --> 00:10:00,053
You said you visited
him every night.

208
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:02,750
Moe the tavern,not Moe the person.

209
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:05,113
Well, promises mean more to me.

210
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:09,483
Okay, you gave your word.

211
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,833
You're going to visit him,

212
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,060
no excuses.

213
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:14,161
Ooh! Shlomo's Judaica is having

214
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,102
a blowout on dreidels.

215
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:21,790
All right, this time I'm going.

216
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:24,743
I'm really going to visit a bank robber.

217
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:26,690
A man who held a gun on me.

218
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,451
Going to see him in prison,

219
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:30,250
where guards will frisk me,

220
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,312
paw through my purse, and...

221
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:35,412
Ooh, there's apple picking just up the road!

222
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:41,113
I'm getting a visitor today.

223
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,741
I'm so nervous it feels like

224
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,570
I keistered a bunch of butterflies.

225
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,743
Dude, I highly doubt
you're getting a visitor.

226
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:47,923
People don't like you.

227
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:50,140
You come off needy and bug-eyed.

228
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:51,180
You're wrong.

229
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,423
Marge is coming.

230
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,131
She is.

231
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:55,733
Easy, bro. It's not like she's your mother.

232
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:56,881
I wish she was.

233
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:59,131
My real mother abandoned
me in an amusement park.

234
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,750
All I have left is a caricature
from that day.

235
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:04,023
Ooh. That is harsh.

236
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:09,620
Hey, baby.

237
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,630
Listen carefully.

238
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,632
Someone's been editing
my biography on Wikipedia.

239
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:14,902
I want you to kill him.

240
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,150
No problem, sweetie.

241
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:17,720
I'll dump his body in
the same lake

242
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:18,971
as your lousy lawyer.

243
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:20,541
Then when you get out,

244
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,900
we can have a picnic there!

245
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:24,202
Aw, that's so sweet.

246
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,233
Anyone for me?

247
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:34,642
I really shouldn't show up without

248
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:36,331
an apple pie for Dwight.

249
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:38,532
In fact, I really shouldn't show up

250
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:41,190
without an apple pie
for everyone at the prison.

251
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:43,110
Oh, my, it's 5:00.

252
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:45,071
I missed visiting hours.

253
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:52,042
Perfect!

254
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:52,870
Look, Lisa.

255
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:54,581
I put new filaments in all

256
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:55,930
our burned-out light bulbs.

257
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,503
Your father, the millionaire,

258
00:11:57,505 --> 00:11:59,021
thought we should throw these away.

259
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,403
Mom, I think there's something

260
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:01,832
you're trying to avoid.

261
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,270
Or someone.

262
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:06,350
Don't be silly, Lisa.

263
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,370
In fact...

264
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:24,161
Damn these sturdy, foreign-built phones.

265
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:27,252
Hello.

266
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,221
Hello?

267
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,483
Hello?

268
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:31,871
Marge?

269
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,460
Hello, this is Ted Nugent,
the Motor City Madman,

270
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:37,202
urging you to vote no
on Proposition 87.

271
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:39,783
If we outlaw crossbows
in our public schools,

272
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,143
who's gonna protect our children

273
00:12:41,155 --> 00:12:42,411
from charging elk?

274
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:44,111
Thank you for your time,
and as always...

275
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:45,520
I say Wango!

276
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:47,501
I say Tango!

277
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:52,880
We now return to

278
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,491
A Kiss Before Frying.

279
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:58,191
It's almost midnight.

280
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,840
They'll be coming soon, Johnny.

281
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:02,222
Coming to take you to the electric chair.

282
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:04,850
I ain't afraid of old sparky,

283
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,520
the hot seat, the kilowatt couch,

284
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,481
the death davenport, the electric lap,

285
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:10,450
the crook cooker, the scorch stool!

286
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,673
I ain't afraid, see?

287
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,253
No, Johnny, I don't see.

288
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:14,920
You're going straight to hell, you know.

289
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:16,920
I ain't afraid, 'cause my sainted Ma

290
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,480
is comin' to visit before I go.

291
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,460
And when I sit down
on the jolt throne,

292
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:22,581
I'll be lookin' into Ma's sweet face

293
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,671
as my tongue explodes in my mouth

294
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:26,831
and the goo boils in my eyes.

295
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:29,373
Oh, poor Johnny Stabbo.

296
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,212
Prison waste

297
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:54,372
Pure mountain spring water

298
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:55,603
Damn it!

299
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:10,280
Ma! Ma! Where are you, Ma?

300
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:12,150
Don't give up hope, Johnny!

301
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:13,512
Give up hope, Johnny.

302
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,251
Your Ma ain't coming.

303
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,901
Now, if I may do the honors.

304
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,040
Ma. Ma. Ma...!

305
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:28,993
Ma.a.a.!!!!

306
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:34,032
Ma...!

307
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:40,263
Hostage returns home to
742 Evergreen terrace

308
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,512
Alarm code 3457

309
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:48,773
Itchy and Scratchy Show.

310
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:58,130
You're out.

311
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,670
Psst, psst!

312
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:05,370
Steroids cause health problems

313
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:07,410
Sluggers make millions.

314
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:18,782
South pole

315
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:21,831
Greatest hero ever

316
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:27,842
You're disgracing America's pastime.

317
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,623
You should be ashamed of yourself.

318
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,620
What the...?

319
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:57,373
Hall of shame

320
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,423
We interrupt this Annie
Award-winning cartoon

321
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:05,671
for an important bulletin.

322
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:07,870
Convicted bank robber
Dwight David Diddle Hopper

323
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:10,070
has escaped from
Springfield Penitentiary.

324
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,770
The escapee left a note
saying he will turn himself

325
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:16,443
in after he takes care of one
unfinished piece of business.

326
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,352
The police have issue da statement saying,

327
00:16:18,358 --> 00:16:19,811
"That seems more than fair."

328
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,581
<i>Who can it be now?</i>

329
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,393
<i>Who can it be now?</i>

330
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:31,363
<i>Who can it be now?</i>

331
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:35,090
<i>Who can it be now?</i>

332
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:39,823
<i>Who can it be knocking at my door?</i>

333
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:41,340
<i>Make no sound</i>

334
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:44,091
<i>Tiptoe across the floor</i>

335
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:46,731
<i>If he hears, he'll knock all...</i>

336
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:48,021
Oh, hey, oh.

337
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:50,443
Oh, wait, this ain't
where I go to vote.

338
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:58,800
Hello, Marge.

339
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:03,363
Man, these cars look all a like.

340
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:05,760
Now drive !

341
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:11,330
Dwight!

342
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:14,592
I-I was just on my way
to see you in prison.

343
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:15,772
Really, Marge?

344
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:17,853
Look me in the eyes and say that.

345
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:18,783
Okay.

346
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:23,693
They're so buggy, I can't.

347
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,621
Dwight, please,
don't do anything crazy.

348
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:31,871
- Just pull over there.
- Huh?

349
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:37,223
Um, what are we doing here?

350
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:39,961
This is where my mom
abandoned me.

351
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:42,340
Oh, that's so sad.

352
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,540
Ya think?

353
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:48,453
Marge, can you please

354
00:17:48,455 --> 00:17:49,983
give me the day my mother didn't?

355
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,382
Ride some rides, eat some cotton candy.

356
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:53,513
I'll let you go home.

357
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,942
Okay, but I'd feel better about it

358
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:57,730
if you got rid of the gun.

359
00:17:57,738 --> 00:17:59,740
I'd like to, but then
you'll leave like she did.

360
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:02,002
Can you at least put it in your jacket ?

361
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:04,600
Fine, but I'm still gonna
make that pointy shape.

362
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:09,790
Krusty.

363
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:12,383
I haven't see you since
that terrifying day.

364
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:16,051
Uh, you'll have to be way more specific.

365
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,592
We were hostages at the bank.

366
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:18,860
Oh, yeah.

367
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:22,291
Sorry I offered your life for my safety.

368
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:24,522
Look, it's Marge!

369
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:25,942
With Dwight !

370
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:28,230
I said there was a spark
between them,

371
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,021
and you said, "No way."

372
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:33,533
I saw it, I just didn't feel like talking to you.

373
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:35,763
Wait, something's screwy here.

374
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,183
I'm calling the cops.

375
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:40,121
Don't bother, they're right over here.

376
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,841
Easy, easy.

377
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:43,291
Line up your shot,

378
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,223
then squeeze it off.

379
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:49,771
Uh, Chief, I think we got
a hostage situation over there.

380
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,920
Can't a man spend one minute
with his stuffed monkey?

381
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:53,892
One minute ?

382
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:55,723
A monkey would make a better chief.

383
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:56,771
What did you say?

384
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,651
I said monkey would
make a better chief!

385
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:01,131
He's a good monkey, all right.

386
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:08,303
The Viking boats!

387
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,562
This is where I lost
my first mom.

388
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:14,390
Well, this mom is not
gonna say bug-eye.

389
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:16,343
I mean, good-bye.

390
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:18,873
Damn it!

391
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:27,140
Boy, I really feel like
a Viking in this thing.

392
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,860
I'll show them which monkey
would make the best chief!

393
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,223
Stop the boats!

394
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:38,710
Sorry, Mister !

395
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,731
Are you kidding me?!

396
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:44,200
Dwight do something!

397
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:45,482
Okay !

398
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:46,632
For you Ma.

399
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:50,902
Great.

400
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:51,880
Dwight!

401
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,162
Are you okay ?

402
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,463
Dwight!

403
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,192
He will be fine.

404
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:59,430
Not you and me fine, but fine.

405
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:01,250
Hey, leave that comedy to me.

406
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:03,640
Okay, funny man, make me laugh.

407
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:09,540
Instead of a carnival ride, what if he was run over

408
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:12,141
by a Zamboni with a moustache?

409
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:14,301
- I don't see how.
- Then I got nothing.

410
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:18,211
Dwight, that was the most

411
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:20,120
unselfish thing I've ever seen.

412
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:22,730
I'm sorry I didn't visit you before.

413
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:23,562
Hey, Marge.

414
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:25,591
Look at us, the four amigos.

415
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:27,762
They're gonna let me do some oddjobs

416
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,161
for them on the outside.

417
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:30,421
Listen, outside my cell,

418
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:32,041
I saw one dandelion growing.

419
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,101
I picked it for you.

420
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,850
Then I pressed it in my Bible to dry.

421
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:39,251
I carved a frame for it
out of a bar of soap.

422
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:41,630
Read the inscription
on the back.

423
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,580
"You chat up the guard at the gate,

424
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:45,952
while I knife the guard behind me."

425
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:48,111
I can't do that, Dwight.

426
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,431
I figured you'd say that.

427
00:20:50,227 --> 00:20:51,561
But you can keep it though.

428
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:53,361
Aw, thank you.

429
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,613
