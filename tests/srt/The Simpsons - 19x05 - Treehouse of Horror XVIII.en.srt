00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:05,155
The Simpsons S19E05 (JABF16 )
Treehouse of Horror XVIII

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,184
Hello.
Remember Halloween?

3
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:09,428
It was last week.

4
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:12,843
But here at the Simpson house,
we're still celebrating.

5
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:18,235
Tonight, we have
three terrifying tales of the...

6
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:19,612
Excuse me.

7
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:24,543
Now, our first gory story is...

8
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:26,579
Oh, for crying out loud!

9
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:30,295
No fair.

10
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:34,370
Can't anyone just watch the
show they're watching?

11
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:51,645
Dinner is served.

12
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:10,327
Mmm. Developed by.

13
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:19,579
Cr�me brul�e!

14
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:20,873
Cr�me brul�e!

15
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:21,753
Or, in English:

16
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:22,923
Burnt cream!

17
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:24,193
Burnt cream!

18
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:24,971
Hold on.

19
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:26,831
I still have to caramelize.

20
00:01:28,437 --> 00:01:30,090
Bart, go out to the shed

21
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:31,992
and get some more butane!

22
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:36,201
...butane this.

23
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,260
What's that unearthly glow?

24
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:46,760
The only sensible thing to do
is explore it on my own.

25
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:50,810
Huh?

26
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:57,591
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:58,623
An alien...

28
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,142
in our butane storage shed.

29
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,591
Is that your space name?

30
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:07,353
No, you hit me in
my 700 testicles.

31
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,690
Why did you come
to our world?

32
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,762
My friends and I came in peace

33
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:13,822
to find your vulnerabilities

34
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:14,823
and, um,

35
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,292
shore them up
with more peace.

36
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:18,121
Yes.

37
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:21,143
Then I was accidentally
left behind...

38
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:23,231
in a spirit of peace.

39
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:25,591
Is that a ray gun?

40
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,360
No, it's a...

41
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:29,721
deodorant applicator.

42
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:30,771
I'll just...

43
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,240
Smells like a
summer breeze.

44
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,343
So, this is my Krusty
dolll0o, Linguo,

45
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:44,930
Iraq War Sergeant Activity

46
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:46,131
with insufficient armor,

47
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:48,042
Phonic Frog, cat skull,

48
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:49,772
Jim Halterman bobblehead doll.

49
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,072
He's a local car dealer.

50
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:51,950
Hmm...

51
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,300
do all humans
have such weak necks

52
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,302
or just the one you call
"Jim Halterman"?

53
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:59,282
Oh, my God, an alien.

54
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:02,302
I'm going to blow Rachel
Goodman away at show-and-tell.

55
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,152
No. If the government
finds out he's here,

56
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:05,241
they'll dissect him.

57
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:08,720
I only hope those scientists
leave me my mouth,

58
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,381
so I may spread my message

59
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:12,093
of peace through song.

60
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:15,073
Peace...

61
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,600
Peace, peace, peace

62
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:19,250
From space.

63
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:21,212
As this month's
rotating president

64
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:24,071
of the Springfield
Future Scientists Club,

65
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,120
may I say I'm sorry

66
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:28,183
and is there anything
we can do to help?

67
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:31,560
Well, I would
like to phone home

68
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:34,083
to tell my family I'm okay.

69
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,650
To do so, I would need
the following items.

70
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:38,680
Get them now.

71
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,393
Fiber-optic cable,

72
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:42,313
uranium 235,

73
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:43,870
two tickets to Avenue Q,

74
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,813
seven billion body bags...

75
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:47,511
Can I hammer that?

76
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:47,941
No.

77
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:48,763
Can I weld that?

78
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:49,243
No!

79
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:49,913
Can I tighten the...

80
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:51,073
I said no!

81
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:52,841
I thought we were supposed
to do this together.

82
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:55,832
Actually, I do have an
important job for you.

83
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:58,311
You can go get the
wrench I dropped.

84
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:00,860
I'm helping! I'm helping!

85
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,571
Way to getrid of Bart.

86
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,980
He can be such a pest.

87
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:07,030
You are very observant, Lisa.

88
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:10,162
That's why I have
a special job for you.

89
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:12,182
Go find out the
secret locations

90
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,952
of your country'smissile
defense facilities.

91
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,142
They were in yesterday's
New York Times.

92
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,993
We'll be killing every human in two days

93
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:25,032
We'll be killing every human in two days

94
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:27,032
We will cook them, we will eat them

95
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:29,141
'Cause that's the way to treat them...

96
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,962
Oh, Ma-arge.

97
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,663
Want some company?

98
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:36,432
As always, silence means yes.

99
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:40,021
How about a little
neck rub, baby?

100
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:44,022
Now, how about the
neck of my butt?

101
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,423
Oh-ho-ho!

102
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:49,433
Someone's taking the highway
to the danger zone.

103
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:52,802
Oh, Marge,your tentacles feel so good.

104
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:54,633
Wait a minute.

105
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,693
Why am I getting
words in edgewise?

106
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:03,721
We can't have a space creature
living in our house.

107
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:05,221
Go ahead. Say it.

108
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:07,260
It's because I'm Jewish.

109
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,600
No, no, no, some of
my best friends are...

110
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,661
Fine, you can stay.

111
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:12,511
Look!

112
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:14,052
They're coming to get...

113
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:14,701
what's your name?

114
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,263
Kodos the Destroyer.

115
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:16,750
Huh?

116
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:17,520
Don't worry, son.

117
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,920
I got a planto save your space doggy.

118
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,001
Who is it?

119
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,700
Ma'am, we have reason to believe

120
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:25,931
that you're harboring an alien.

121
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:27,282
Open this doorat once.

122
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,993
Oh, I'm not decent.

123
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,492
Let me throw something on.

124
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,202
Can I help you, gentlemen?

125
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:36,962
Uh, we know it'syou, Mr. Simpson.

126
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,053
Now where is the alien?

127
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,811
Wow, you guys are good.

128
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:41,513
The alien's right here
in the living room.

129
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,372
Ha! You missed 'em.

130
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,060
Bart and our alien friend are

131
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:49,300
hundreds of miles away by now.

132
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:54,020
What do you weigh?

133
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:55,330
Like a million pounds?

134
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:56,931
More of meto love.

135
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:57,871
After them!

136
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:01,702
The South shall rise again.

137
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:17,081
We can fly over them with
the power of love, right?

138
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,253
Hmm... we could, or...

139
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:26,803
You killed them.

140
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:28,850
Well done, Columbo.

141
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,142
That's right. We watch Columbo.

142
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:34,563
It's on during rain-outs
of gleep-glop games.

143
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,660
I'm just gonna take off now.

144
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,475
I'm sure you have a lot
of calls to make.

145
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:41,037
Foolish biped.

146
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,399
It's not a phone.

147
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,082
It's a space portal.

148
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,343
Our shock troops will teleportin

149
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:48,502
and eat everyone's heads,

150
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,310
all thanks to you.

151
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,331
What did I miss?

152
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:22,501
Hop in, Bart.

153
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,072
They're gonna let us kill one!

154
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:32,681
Bart... friend?

155
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:40,520
Homer... bored!

156
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,892
I can't believe that
an alien who looked

157
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:48,640
so evil turned out to be bad.

158
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:51,311
Hmm. I guess you should
judge a book by its cover.

159
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,223
Definitely, especially if you count

160
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,223
the inside flap as part of the cover.

161
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,252
It usually gives you a great idea

162
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:58,621
of what the book's about.

163
00:07:58,628 --> 00:07:59,152
Quiet.

164
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:01,093
We're missing the dissection!

165
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:03,351
Actually, I'm still alive,

166
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:05,422
so technically, it's vivisection.

167
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,183
No one likes a know-it-all.

168
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:30,020
You see, the problem
is we've grown apart.

169
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:31,921
The problem is

170
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,013
you don't share my interest

171
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,332
in not being with you.

172
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:36,242
Another thing:

173
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,223
I don't knowwhere you go at night.

174
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:00,923
Greetings, 241.

175
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:03,032
Why does he always bring up my weight?

176
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:05,593
I want you to eliminate this reporter,

177
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:06,800
Kent Brockman.

178
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:08,411
He found the gully where I dump

179
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,862
electricity every summer

180
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,053
to jack up prices.

181
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:11,793
Don't worry, sir.

182
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:13,150
I'll handle this cleanly,

183
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:14,662
quietly and... Bart!

184
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:15,832
What?

185
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:18,803
Marge, I'm gonna behome late tonight.

186
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,133
I'm going to, uh...

187
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:23,782
Midnight Monkey
Madness at the zoo.

188
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:25,252
Well, I won'tbe home, either.

189
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,422
I'm, um...

190
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:29,423
flipping overwheelbarrows in case it rains.

191
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,623
Have funat your crazy-sounding thing.

192
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,920
And you have fun at
your preposterous event.

193
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:34,731
- Love ya.
- Love ya.

194
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:37,902
And that was my drink.

195
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:43,052
Ninth floor.

196
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:44,283
Assassin's perch.

197
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,111
Now all I have to do is think of a

198
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,573
clever line before I pull the trigger.

199
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:06,493
Oh, that's a perfect one.

200
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:09,102
But I don't need to say it
out loud 'cause I'm by myself.

201
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,491
Out of my way, mystery skank!

202
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,772
Hey! Now I don't get paid!

203
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:25,740
Hey, baby, hello.

204
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,130
Now I'm mad!

205
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:40,103
Now I'm...

206
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:52,441
Marge is a professional assassin!

207
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:01,831
You just can't get
Russian gangster blood out.

208
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,112
Must be something they eat.

209
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,331
Hey, what's that?

210
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,600
A blender cozy.

211
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,642
How was your Midnight
Monkey Madness?

212
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:17,982
Great, great.

213
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,101
I turned over so many wheelbarrows...

214
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:22,540
Wait. That was your thing.

215
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,100
Homie,

216
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:30,772
I made you my killer lasagna.

217
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,342
It's poison!

218
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:34,401
Whatever you do, don't eat it.

219
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,650
Okay, you' already eating it,
but don't finish it.

220
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:41,793
Okay, you finished it,
but don't ask for...

221
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:42,683
Seconds, please.

222
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:44,311
You moron!
Just kill her!

223
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:46,501
I'll kill her after dessert!

224
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,053
You're a killer for hire!

225
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,462
You ruined that pie!

226
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,360
How could you not tell me
you were an assassin?

227
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,290
How could you not tell me?

228
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:03,041
I told you 20 times!

229
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:04,172
You never listen!

230
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,712
Well, they're not
as pretty as you, Marge.

231
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,342
Listen, I...
Oh!

232
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:31,813
Okay, here's the deal.

233
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,413
I'll do the killing for hire,

234
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:34,892
and you stay home with the kids.

235
00:12:36,718 --> 00:12:38,422
I get $50,000 a hit.

236
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:39,643
How much do you make?

237
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,872
I just get to keep
whatever's in the guy's wallet.

238
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,660
All those nights I thought
you were out getting drunk,

239
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,712
you were out killing people?!

240
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,323
I was out getting drunk,
then killing people!

241
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:13,412
Stop it!

242
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:14,883
That's my favorite couch!

243
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,732
Why do you think I'm kicking it?

244
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,563
Are you guys fighting over us?

245
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:24,232
Whatever we did, we're sorry.

246
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,493
Sweeties...

247
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:29,563
We weren't fighting.

248
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:30,842
It sounded like you were.

249
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,980
Who wants ice cream in bed?

250
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:34,583
Ice cream! Ice cream!

251
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:35,681
Dad's the best!

252
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:38,531
Great! Now they're going to have
tummy aches tomorrow.

253
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:40,842
And where will
"Super Dad" be then?

254
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:42,391
At your funeral.

255
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:50,001
We got a complaint from
an anonymous "neighborino"

256
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,812
about an elaborately choreographed,
high-octane, ultra-fight.

257
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:57,020
I would have taken a bribe.

258
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,233
Oh, that was so hot!

259
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:03,031
I love watching you do other guys!

260
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,373
Mmm, I'd like to see you
do a guy sometime.

261
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:08,282
That can be arranged.

262
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:21,170
Oh, what a wonderful night.

263
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:27,463
...so, killing people together
has really spiced things up

264
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,643
in the bedroom.

265
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,720
That's terrific,
but I called you here to discuss

266
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,852
your son's misbehavior
on the school bus.

267
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:37,872
Think of me on Pizza Fridays.

268
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,351
Trick or treat!

269
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,673
Beat it, weirdoes!
I don't do Halloween!

270
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:59,152
You're supposed
to give us candy.

271
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,401
I got your candy right here.

272
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,893
Weirdoes!

273
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,751
She empty-bagged us!

274
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:07,920
What do we do now?

275
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:08,950
Hear me out.

276
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:11,943
It seems to me we gave her
a choice: trick or treat.

277
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:14,073
She didn't give us a treat, so...

278
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,022
Bart, where are
you heading with this?

279
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:18,203
"Trick or Treat" isn't
just some phrase you chant

280
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:20,202
mindlessly like The Lord's Prayer.

281
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,693
It's an oral contract!

282
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,872
You're right.
We've forgotten the old ways.

283
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,572
The ways of rotten eggs
and soaped-up windows.

284
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:28,320
I say we trick her!

285
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,771
Trick her good!

286
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:31,290
Yay!

287
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:40,422
May I remind you that I'm

288
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:41,800
your principal's mother?!

289
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,560
I hope the next people
don't give us anything

290
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:54,313
so we can trick them too!

291
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:55,362
Why give 'em a choice?

292
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:58,092
That trick was sweeter than any
treat we'll get tonight.

293
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,630
I'm concerned we might be
heading down a slippery slope.

294
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,160
What do you think, Nelson?

295
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:04,243
Can't talk.
Lighting poo.

296
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:07,241
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

297
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:10,060
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

298
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:12,711
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

299
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,510
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

300
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:17,392
<i>They're forming in straight line</i>

301
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,160
<i>They're going through a tight wind</i>

302
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:22,861
<i>The kids are losing their minds</i>

303
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:24,643
<i>The blitzkrieg bop</i>

304
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:27,682
<i>Hey ho, let's go!</i>

305
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:38,521
Excuse me, but this is not good!

306
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,340
Oh, lighten up.
It's Halloween.

307
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:42,420
A night for mischief and merriment.

308
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:45,351
Trick-or-treat!
Lick my feet!

309
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,502
! taem ttub-gip ekilsllems daeh ruoY

310
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:50,951
Those monsters must be stopped!

311
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:52,921
Perhaps, I can be
of some assistance.

312
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:00,050
I've got something that will scare the
H-E-double sippy straws out of them.

313
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:04,643
Hold still!

314
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:12,243
How is this a prank?
Give me back my TV!

315
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:13,743
I fed your fish.

316
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:14,953
You overfed them!

317
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:16,422
You're the worst one of all!

318
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:27,193
Whoa! They turned the church
into a haunted house!

319
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:29,422
"Scaredy cats not wanted"?

320
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,071
Then I am wanted!

321
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:37,092
Welcome to Heck House!

322
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,680
You're about to discover

323
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:40,071
what a life of sin will get you!

324
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,442
Sin gets us something?
Awesome!

325
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,203
I was just in it for the sin.

326
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,492
Just get in there!

327
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:50,002
Welcome to eternal darnation!

328
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:53,653
May I have a clean American
newspaper, please,

329
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,020
no "Doonesbury"?

330
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:58,581
Wouldn't you rather have
a bikini magazine?

331
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:00,502
I guess a little peek won't hurt me.

332
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:02,451
No!

333
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:05,851
He died as he lived--like a dork.

334
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:10,300
No! The lesson here is
he's being punished

335
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,940
for thinking women are beautiful!

336
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,393
Please, Lord, grant me the power

337
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:18,932
to psychologically torture them
into loving you.

338
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:26,403
Behold, the
las-diddily-ast room

339
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,812
of Ned Flanders's Hell House!

340
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:34,270
I warned ya.

341
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,743
And yet my punishment
is no less severe.

342
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:37,822
That's odd.

343
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:50,550
Springfield is rife
with the seven deadly sins!

344
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:52,571
Starting with... gluttony!

345
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:03,930
More bread, please.

346
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,643
Anger!

347
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:12,333
Why won't you work,
you stupid piece of junk?!

348
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:20,931
I said, why won't you work?!

349
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,310
Pride!

350
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:31,433
Oh, why did I take pride
in my child's accomplishments?

351
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,630
Sloth!

352
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:37,450
I thought I was killed
by that magic spaghetti!

353
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,391
And the rest!

354
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:44,462
Lust!

355
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:48,180
Greed!

356
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,063
And envy!

357
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:53,981
Oh, how I envy the crotchless.

358
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:57,263
And this is where sinners spend
all of eternity!

359
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,161
This is what you get
for stealing jokes?!

360
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:06,203
I keep telling you: I'm Hindu!

361
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:08,033
I regret... nothing.

362
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:10,731
- Stop licking my junk!
- It's my junk, too!

363
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,583
We'll never do any of those sins...

364
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:15,901
I promise!

365
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:19,333
All we'll do from now on
is pray and fight in wars.

366
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,061
Well, then, my work is done.

367
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:25,450
That concludes our Halloween
show for this year.

368
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,453
I just want to say
that for watching this network,

369
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:28,813
you're all going to hell!

370
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:31,012
And that includes FX, Fox Sports,

371
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:34,001
and our newest Devil's portal,
The Wall Street Journal.

372
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:35,281
Welcome to the club!
