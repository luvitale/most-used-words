Whoa - the infamous Wolverine
comic with pop-out claws

8
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:38,413
Why was this so controversial...

9
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,358
nice work DR Boo-hoo...

10
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,958
your tears have smudged
Wolverine's iconic sideburns

11
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:49,438
Hence you must by this comic...

12
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:52,863
and the cost of your innocent
accident is.....

13
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:54,963
twenty-five dollars please...

14
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,063
but that's the money
Yiayia Sophia...

15
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:59,968
gave me for Greek Orthodox Easter

16
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:02,363
I hate when they tell me
things about themselves

17
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:04,778
You should stop being so mean
to us kids

18
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:08,068
Well I suppose you could buy
your comics somewhere else...

19
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:11,483
maybe they sell comics at
the dry cleaners...

20
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,648
no, perhaps they sell comics
at the mattress store...

21
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:15,778
or perhaps you could
buy your comics at...

22
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:18,933
that new comic book store
across the street

23

00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:23,573
it's as if Superman
moved to Gotham City...

25
00:02:23,673 --> 00:02:27,498
which he did in
Worlds Finest Comics Number 94

26
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:28,798
See...

27
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,108
it was an imaginary story
dreamt by Jimmy Olsen...

28
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,053
after he was kicked in the head
by Supergirl's horse Comet...

29
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,353
it never really happened...

30
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,683
none of these things
ever really happen...

31
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,783
get out of my store

32

47
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:52,893

in high school french classes

48
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:54,793
Come on Snowy

49
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:56,293
We must save the
Belgian Ambassador...

50
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:58,603
from the Black Orchid Gang

51
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,333
What's that?
a shot of ignition?

52
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:03,428
zoot-a-loft.

53
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,898
this castle is actually
a four stage rocket...

54
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:10,993
and it's headed straight for
the Pompidou centre

55
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:15,298
Oh no I ripped it

56
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:17,398
Hey no worries little lady...

57
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:19,879
these books are meant to be
read and enjoyed...

58
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,174
not hoarded and then sold
when you get divorced.

59
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:25,274

wonderment form all...

OK. Well the Mulk kicked
a tidal wave into the sun

70
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:54,609
Whereas the Thung gave a piggy
back ride to the 1985 Chicago Bears

71
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,709
Hoo boy that's a tough one

72
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,809
What do you think?

73
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,109

74
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,209

relationship with my...

77
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:10,319
ex comic book guy
I forgot how good it could be

78
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,419

82
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:30,817

00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:41,382
She's depressed
because you're so lame

89
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:43,482
Shut up.

90
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:48,927

92
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,542

93
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:54,642

Dan Clowes

98
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:09,623
I've really identified with
the girls in Ghost World...

99
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:11,923
they made me feel like
I wasn't so alone...

100
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:13,823

101
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:15,853
Do you know anyone who
works at Batman...

102
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:18,713

draw Batman

106
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:27,728
Uh huh

107

Radioactive Man

109
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:32,928
Oh really...

favourite superhero...

111
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,028
a heroin addicted jazz critic...

112
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,428
who's not radioactive

113
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:42,213
I don't read the words. I just
like it when he punches people...

114
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:46,573
how do you make his costume
stick so close to his muscles

115
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:47,873

they take your ideas and
they suck them...

120
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:01,103
suck them like leeches
until they've gotten...

121
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:04,558
every last drop of the marrow
from your bones

122
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,718
Hey Tea-cup.

Attention comic book aficionados

00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:24,648
This man is not one of us

128
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,298
He has a girlfriend {all gasp}

the orient to children...

136
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,428

137

thing to do is...

141
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:54,953
{Screams}

142
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:02,208

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,845
I wish there was a gym for
us regular ladies

159
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:42,641

Marge, I wish you well...

163
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:49,423

to go to a gym...

164
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,523
if there were no men there...

165
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:54,088
watching the and judging them

166
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:58,923
We're gunna be rich...

167
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:01,320
we can finally start a family

168
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,716
We have a family...

169
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:04,816
a better one

170
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:10,116
Switch stations

171
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:13,516
I love this gym...

172
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:14,616
me too

173
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:18,751
Finally an exercise bike
for women of a certain age

174
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,951
Jurassic aha ha ha ha

175
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:26,941
Mum every workout appointment
is booked up for months

176
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,241
We'll have to open a second Shapes

177
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:33,166
We just need to find a
vacant rental property

178
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,601
I can't believe the labour board
is shutting me down...

179
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,601
you lock your workers in at night

180
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:46,901
It's so they can't
tell their stories

181
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,401
Mr Krusty came to my village

182
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,101
He said he would marry me

183
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:54,176
No ring
just fill apple pies all day

184
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:08,501
Today's guest created
a womens only gym...

185
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,276
that's taken the tri-county
area by storm

186
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:14,076
Marge Simpson

187
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,306
Marge, I thank you
for creating Shapes...

188
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:24,551
and uh my boyfriend
thanks you too...

189
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:29,206

going to pop the question?

190
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:30,833
uh uh.............

191
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:34,126

cuckoo clocks...

192
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,826
you're getting a cuckoo clock...

193
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,926
and you're getting
a cuckoo clock...

194
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,026
and you're getting
a cuckoo clock...

195
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:42,931
and you're getting a cuckoo clock

196
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:52,946
Oh yeh Marge, I love
these business trips of yours...

197
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,841
the T.V. remote isn't nailed on...

198
00:11:55,941 --> 00:12:00,871
my whole life I've never
been in a hotel that trusted me...

199
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:10,506
hors d'oeuvres, big
fancy desserts...

200
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,066
and my wife is paying
for everything...

201
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,971
now I know why pimps
are so happy...

202
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:19,641
yep nothing beats living on
'wife support'

203
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:21,741
I hear that...

204
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,276
yo guys,
come meet a new husband...

205
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,201
hey how yo doin?
I'm Homer...

206
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:29,786
my wife invented a gym for
'regular women'

207
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:34,371
my wife invested Sky Pills, she
mixed vitamins with alka-seltzer...

208
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:35,671
and pretended it was medicine

209
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,171
I pay ten dollars
a tube for those...

210
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,671
that's why I drive a Bentley

211
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:41,271
Yep. I haven't decided
what kind of new car to get...

212
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:43,356
you better decide soon as
I have a feeling...

213
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:45,841
your wife will also be getting
a new model...

214
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:47,741
yeh she'll be trading up...

215
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:50,741
and they're not
talking about cars...

216
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:52,781
are you sure they're
not talking about cars?

217
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,381
because those are car words

218
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,481
Homer, we're all second husbands...

219
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:58,666
as soon as our wives hit it big
they dumped the fat old guys...

220
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,231
they were with and married us

221
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:03,846
Marge won't dump me

222
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:07,686
I'm the anchor that
keeps her weighed down...

223
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:08,831
here's how it starts...

224
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:10,231
she gets a total make-over...

225
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,016
then she starts wearing
fancy new clothes...

226
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:15,596
then she stops wanting to
tell you about her day...

227
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:17,836
here's how you know she's
really about to go...

228
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:20,481
your wife seems happy
and full of life...

229
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:22,581
that will never happen

230
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:26,781
Marge. Marge.

231
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:30,981
the makeover...

232
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:34,736
oh my god the prophecy
is being fulfilled...

233
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:39,061
um so tell me about your day...

234
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:42,041
oh you don't want to hear about
my boring old day

235
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:43,341
I do. I do.

236
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:46,166
well the first inspirational
speech of the day...

237
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:48,796
was by the woman who climbed
Mt Everest...

238
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,896
and got everyone else killed.

239
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,431
hey the networks are different
channels in this city

240
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,916
It's O.K.
I don't care that you don't care...

241
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:58,016
go watch your thing...

242
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:02,166
are you happy and full of life

243
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,266
I sure am

244
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:21,566
Marge, now that you're rich...

245
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,811
you really should
get rid of that bag

246
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:28,256
Really' but I'm so
used to my old one

247
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:31,396
Old one? They're convincing
Marge to dump me

248
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,251
Oh it's easy
I get a new one every two years...

249
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:35,351
from Italy...

250
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:38,001
you would love a big black one

251
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:41,091
Marge, get away from them...

252
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:42,756
what's gotten into you?

253
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:46,341
I'm going to the successful
ladies room...

254
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:50,766
you guys have got to help me

255
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:54,241
If Marge leaves I'll have nothing
except my many friends...

256
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,886
and half the fortune
she is now making...

257
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:58,511
and will continue to make

258
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,611
Homer I'm going to let you in
on a secret

259
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,511
I'm a first husband

260
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,651
I used to look like this

261
00:15:05,577 --> 00:15:07,377
What's your secret?

262
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:08,477
oh there's no secret

263
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:09,777
Just hard work uh-huh...

264
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,877
exercise two hours a day O.K.

265
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,977
keep up with the latest fashions
Fashions...

266
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,857
and of course cut out all
fatty foods and alcohol...

267
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,657
uh-huh uh-huh got it

268
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:22,837
I know just what it will take
to hang onto Marge

269
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:29,937
Mr Simpson let me outline...

270
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:33,502
the gastric bypass surgery
procedure for you O.K.

271
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:35,602
we put the band
around your stomach...

272
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,237
so that no solid food may enter...

273
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,337
you see just like so

274
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:43,022
It's a very very
serious operation...

275
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:46,492
you should only undergo it
as a last resort...

276
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,852
please doc. I know I'm not the...

277
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:49,332
greatest looking
guy in the world...

278
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,522
but I took care of my family
and that used to be enough...

279
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,622
but not anymore...

280
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,022
very well. If you wish...

281
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,502
we can perform the procedure
in the office today.

282
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:00,862
and I know how I can
knock myself out

283
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:02,962
I'll look at your bill

284
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,052
Hmm I guess considering all the
training you've received...

285
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:07,552
this is quite reasonable

286
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:10,797
I've never seen anything
so reasonable

287
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:13,447
It's the bargain of a lifetime

288
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,927
Dad are you O.K.

289
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:21,357
I see food on your plate
instead of blurring motions

290
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:24,857
Kids your daddy underwent a
special procedure...

291
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:27,627
so he can be more attractive
to your mother...

292
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:29,227
you had your hotdog plumped

293
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,962
No. I had my stomach stapled...

294
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:54,327
oh all food tastes like barf now

295
00:16:57,027 --> 00:16:59,027
Homey I'm back...

296
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:01,127
[Marge Gasps]

297
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,427
Welcome home Marge

298
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:08,292
You remembered I like romance...

299
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:10,497
a smart successful
woman like you...

300
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,497
deserves the very best...

301
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:15,172
you also remembered
I like flattery...

302
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:17,567
do you like guys who are...

303
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,272
attractive

304
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,072
Homey, you look good...

305
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,872
all for you baby...

306
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,972
let me get a good look at you...

307
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:28,872
uh uh woah woah
slow down sexy beast...

308
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:31,572
why don't you take some time to
savor the front...

309
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:33,172
what are you hiding from me?

310
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:35,272
is it chocolate

311
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:36,672
It used to be...

312
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:39,832
woah - those buns
are poppin fresh...

313
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:43,602
yeah, I'm going to turn
off the lights now...

314
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:46,332
and I'll just fold this
old sweaty blanket...

315
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,727
and put it in the closet...

316
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:51,032
ow ow ow ow ow ow

317
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:54,597
Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show
my body to my wife...

318
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:56,757
and it's all because of
your surgery...

319
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:59,632
you want me to
unstaple your stomach...

320
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:03,042
no I want you to give me
every other surgery you have...

321
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:04,432
so I can look good...

322
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:06,742
and can you call it
an aortic valve replacement...

323
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,342
so my insurance will cover it...

324
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:10,442
no problem

325
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:12,642
O.K. count backwards from ten...

326
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:15,782
fine I admit it I'm drunk...

327
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,477
and so to honour her success

328
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,272
I bestow upon Marge Simpson...

329
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:28,197
this $100 gift card
to sweat pants etcetera...

330
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:31,707
did someone order a superstud?

331
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:35,532
oh my implants feel itchy...

332
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,552
yes I was out of silicone rubber...

333
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:40,032
so I used rolled up socks...

334
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,377
[crowd: gasps in horror]...

335
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:43,877
he's a monster...

336
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:45,977
pitchforks everyone...

337
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:49,477
monster, monster monster...

338
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,577
monster monster...

339
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,577
cut his heart out...

340
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,047
listen Homer
I've got to be honest with you...

341
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,057
you better not make me cry...

342
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:12,322
cause I don't know where
my tear ducts are anymore

343
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:15,597
I appreciate you trying to become
more attractive for me...

344
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,097
but the truth is

345
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,087
I'm way too successful for you now

346
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:23,222
I'm getting me a trophy husband

347
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:29,867
I don't want to live
without you Marge

348
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,967
O.K.

349
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,167
Huh? huh? what? hey.

350
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,347
why do I look like me again?

351
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,912
the doctor called me about all
the crazy surgeries you wanted...

352
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:46,412
and I said NO.

353
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:48,412
but I did have him
unstaple your stomach...

354
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:52,082
and turn you back into
the sweet man I love

355
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:54,182
It was all a dream?

356
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:55,382
I never became a hideous monster?

357
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:57,552
the only person who
thinks you're a monster...

358
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:01,307
is the one who had to give
you a sponge bath...

359
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,932
and dad I hope you
learned something from this

360
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:05,232
I sure have...

361
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,312
plastic surgery is a mistake...

362
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:10,397
because it hasn't been perfected
to where you look really good...

363
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:12,802
when it is everyone should get it

364
00:20:12,902 --> 00:20:14,902
Amen...

365
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:19,967
listen Marge, I've been
wondering all these years...

366
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:23,267
what is it about me that
you find so irresistible?

367
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,687
lets face it you could do better...

368
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:27,787
well maybe I could...

369
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:29,387
but every time I look at you

370
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:33,397
I see the same adorable boy
I fell in love with...

371
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:35,497
ooohhh...

372
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:38,512
well there's nothing like
a happy ending

373
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,912
Holy Heavens.

374
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:42,857
is that a meteor heading
for the earth...

375
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:45,137
maybe but tonight
there's a benefit...

376
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:48,057
for underpaid comic book artists
of the 40's and 50's

377
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:50,157
to the cashbar



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
