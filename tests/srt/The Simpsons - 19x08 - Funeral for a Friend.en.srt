1
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:08,760
The Simpsons S19E08 (KABF01)
Funeral for a Fiend

2
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:29,856
Can I help you
with that, sir?

3
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:30,503
Oh, no.

4
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:33,664
I ain't tippin' some jerk two bucks
to tie a TV to my car.

5
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,614
Mama Moe didn't raise no fools.

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,779
Well,

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,771
I guess I can just keep
watching DVDs

8
00:00:42,772 --> 00:00:44,786
by following family vans around.

9
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,092
Big Bird in China?

10
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:50,450
Won't Grover get lonely?

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,842
Oh, no, wait.

12
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,534
He's hangin' out
with Derek Jeter.

13
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,153
Now ignore all the fancy

14
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,631
shmancy things thingamajigs, boy.

15
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:00,081
We're just gonna get a
camera battery and go home.

16
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:01,271
Are you interested in a car stereo?

17
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,881
No, thanks. Just here
for a battery.

18
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:04,681
Big special on camcorders!

19
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:05,882
All I want is a battery.

20
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:07,213
Care to make love, sir?

21
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:08,581
Battery, battery, battery!

22
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:11,011
Hmm...

23
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:12,770
No!

24
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:14,372
Bingo!

25
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:16,413
One battery, please.

26
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:17,553
That'll be 50 cents,

27
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,573
or free with the purchase
of a $200 TiVO

28
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:21,930
plus a two-year contract.

29
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:22,660
Sold!

30
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:24,123
Sucker.

31
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:29,991
Sir, your TiVO?

32
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:30,723
My what now?

33
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:33,462
Oh, no.

34
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:34,522
Oh!

35
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:36,173
Come on, Lisa!

36
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:38,971
The TV's been off
for five whole minutes!

37
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:42,211
The TiVO is installed!

38
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:44,833
Now we catch shows
and skip the commercials!

39
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,103
Will Itchy win again,

40
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:11,672
or will something else happen?

41
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,171
We'll find out right after
these ten commercials.

42
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,862
Oh, no, we won't.

43
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19,292
Whoa!

44
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:22,542
I spit on your corpse, advertisers

45
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,292
supporting television.

46
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:26,223
Yeah!

47
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:30,290
And now for the
exciting conclusion!

48
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:36,112
Oh, the hilarity!

49
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:38,520
Mmm.

50
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,672
Without the commercial interruption,

51
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:46,322
I could really follow the story.

52
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:49,790
TiVo, you've got a season
pass to my heart.

53
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:54,882
Ooh, Opal!

54
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,790
Sounds like you've given
us some words to eat by.

55
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:03,772
Doctor Chef will be back
after these messages!

56
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,093
Here's a message for you.

57
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:10,471
Welcome back.

58
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:12,252
I have some big, big news.

59
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:15,100
My boyfriend Straightman
just proposed...

60
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:19,463
...that we go on separate
vacations again this year!

61
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:23,262
Hmm. I think I'll speed
through the cheering.

62
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,632
Oh, TiVO remote

63
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:33,781
you've changed my life.

64
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:35,642
I've gotten so much accomplished.

65
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:37,020
I saved Lost,

66
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:38,600
watched all Rome in a day,

67
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:40,543
and got Two and a half men in

68
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:41,793
two and a half minutes.

69
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:43,892
Then I ran out of space

70
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,440
and had to choose
between Sophie's Choice

71
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:47,872
and Schindler's list.

72
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:51,242
Why is everything Hollywood
make so excellent?

73
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,430
Why?

74
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:56,982
Marge Simpson!

75
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:57,640
Oh!

76
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,523
Keith Olbermann?!

77
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:00,300
That's right,

78
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,753
content burglar Marge Simpson.

79
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:04,203
You've been watching TV shows,

80
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,280
but skipping the commercials
that pay for them.

81
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,352
That makes you...

82
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:10,330
the worst person in the world!

83
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,913
Oh, lighten up.

84
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:17,250
You TV fat cats have plenty of money.

85
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,313
My cousin Marine saw you
flying in business class!

86
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:22,520
I was upgraded against my will!

87
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,362
Look Marge, you think
I'm handsome don't you?

88
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,201
Of course.

89
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:29,162
It takes a team of 20 people
to keep me that way,

90
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,241
without ad money,

91
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:32,923
I'd look like a swamp monster
from a child's nightmare!

92
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,632
And under here,
I look even worse.

93
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:37,420
Then it gets better,

94
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:40,381
then even worse!

95
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,271
Oh stop it!

96
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:43,812
Oh stop it!
I'll watch the commercials!

97
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:50,183
That's why this is the only
mop endorsed by me,

98
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:52,850
former NFL draft pick, Ryan Leaf.

99
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:54,781
Mom, what are you doing?

100
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,950
I'm honoring America's advertisers.

101
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,691
Then we're going to buy some
toothpaste, lease a new car,

102
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:01,902
vote "yes" on prop 87.

103
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:03,012
No! No!

104
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:06,031
Prop 87 lets big polluters off the hook!

105
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,420
Impossible.

106
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:10,013
Their commercial featured a talking frog.

107
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,740
So tell those idiots
in the State Capital

108
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:15,473
to let Union Carbide do their thing.

109
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:17,800
Paid for by Cartoon Frogs For
Wetlands Destruction.

110
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:21,782
Howdy, folks!

111
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:25,163
Are you tired of family arguments
over where to go to dinner?

112
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:28,913
Sometimes I think about gettin' on
a bus and never comin' back.

113
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,732
Why not try Wes Doobner's World

114
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,553
Famous Family Style Rib Huts?

115
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:35,363
The rib joint with something
for everyone.

116
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,673
Good luck with my finicky appetite.

117
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:38,661
We've got ribs.

118
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:39,173
Sold!

119
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:40,353
Plain noodles.

120
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:40,850
Ugh.

121
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:41,661
With butter.

122
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:42,610
Yowza!

123
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:44,081
Texas tofu!

124
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,091
Yummy, yumma!

125
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:48,730
And the easiest placemat
puzzle in the state.

126
00:05:48,737 --> 00:05:49,663
Let me at it!

127
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:58,722
<i>We're going to a restaurant grand opening</i>

128
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:01,703
<i>But don't fill up on bread</i>

129
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:04,740
That's how they get ya.

130
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:07,853
That's odd. There doesn't
seem to be anyone here.

131
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:09,390
More ribs for me!

132
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,373
There aren't any
tables or chairs.

133
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,583
More ribs for me!

134
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:16,840
I see no grill, oven or food of any kind.

135
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:18,213
More ribs for me?

136
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:22,451
Hello,

137
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:24,080
Simpsons.

138
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:29,462
Finally, some service.
Now listen.

139
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:32,203
We want to sit under a cool
state license plate.

140
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:34,043
Michigan or better.

141
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:34,862
Silence!

142
00:06:34,865 --> 00:06:37,201
You've all stumbled into my ingenious trap.

143
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,360
That voice!

144
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,152
Oh!

145
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:41,154
That commercial was a trick.

146
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,653
Specifically designed to lure
our family here.

147
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,611
And "Wes Doobner's World
Famous Family

148
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:49,560
Style Rib Huts" is actually an
anagram!

149
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:52,491
Welcome to Sideshow
Bob's World Famous

150
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,400
Family Style Return!

151
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:56,930
Ahhhhhhh!

152
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,373
Sideshow Bob!

153
00:06:58,387 --> 00:06:59,880
And now you're all going to die,

154
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:02,102
just because you watched
a television commercial!

155
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, next time a commercial comes on,
I'm gonna close my eyes,

156
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,273
cover my ears and
scream as loud as I can.

157
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:10,033
Before you die, perhaps
you'd like to know

158
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:12,663
how I engineered my ultimate revenge.

159
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,712
I'd like to know if Wes Doobner is aware

160
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:16,903
of what you're doing
in his restaurant.

161
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:18,781
I'm Wes Doobner.

162
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:20,323
Mr. Doobner, I havea complaint:

163
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,451
I work hard, and when I
go out with my family,

164
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:24,152
I expect a certain
level of basic

165
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:24,822
Shut up!

166
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:26,792
Now, since last we met...

167
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,481
Oh great, here it comes

168
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:29,802
all the boring things you've done

169
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,570
since the last time
you didn't kill us.

170
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:33,603
You never ask what
we've been up to.

171
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,082
We went to the strawberry patch

172
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,981
and I picked the most strawberries!

173
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,720
Shut up!

174
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:39,753
This time, to liven up my tale,

175
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,212
I brought along some visual aids.

176
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:42,463
Just call me...

177
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,390
Slideshow Bob!

178
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,462
Nobody do it.

179
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:49,270
Here, we see Krusty helping
you escape my clutches in Rome.

180
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:50,160
After that,

181
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,081
my family and I fled to England,

182
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:54,771
where I found work as a chimney brush.

183
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,130
Here's Buckingham Palace...

184
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:01,503
Sorry, there's a lot of these...

185
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:02,612
Bear with me.

186
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,103
Yeah, yeah, we've all been to England.

187
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:10,521
Is this going somewhere?

188
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:13,002
I never stopped plotting my revenge.

189
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:14,791
I snuck into America

190
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:16,731
amidst a bunch of undocumented
Canadian

191
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:19,680
comedy writers for
The Jimmy Kimmel Show,

192
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:20,550
whatever that is.

193
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,493
Then, it was merely a matter

194
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:24,701
of constructing my trap...

195
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,600
and producing the commercial

196
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,730
that lured you to your dooms.

197
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:29,480
Which, by the way,

198
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,161
got me an offer to direct a feature.

199
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:31,770
Which one?

200
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:34,062
"The Hills Have Eyes Three:
The Hills Still Have Eyes".

201
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,340
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for...

202
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,171
Finally, the ribs.

203
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:40,420
You shall all perish
in a tragic accident

204
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:42,731
caused by a defective laptop battery

205
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:43,610
that will overheat,

206
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:47,302
then explode, setting off this TNT.

207
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:48,441
Hooooooo!

208
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:49,463
Let's not tarry

209
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:50,650
as Shakespeare said,

210
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:52,003
"If it were done when it's done,

211
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:54,553
then 'twere best it were done quickly. "

212
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:55,892
Power on.

213
00:08:56,926 --> 00:08:58,231
<i>Looks like you're trying
to blow up the computer.</i>

214
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,531
<i>Mind if hug my kids?</i>

215
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:01,971
This time,

216
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:04,261
I've made no mistakes.

217
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,342
Actually, you made one.

218
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,310
What Shakespeare really said was,

219
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,583
"Twere well it were done quickly. "

220
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:13,221
Yes, I'm sure, you've studied
the Immortal Bard

221
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:15,152
extensively under your

222
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:16,663
Miss Hoover.

223
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:20,031
Macbeth, act one, scene seven.

224
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:21,090
Look it up!

225
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,371
I shall.

226
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,960
Come on, Wikipedia,

227
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:34,080
load, you unwieldy behemoth.

228
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:37,511
Oh, dear

229
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:39,103
Sideshow Bob,

230
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:43,023
"hoist on his own petard. "

231
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:45,172
It's "hoist with
his own petard. "

232
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:46,231
Oh, get a life.

233
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:49,581
Yet another new restaurant fails.

234
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,282
Ten-time attempted murderer
and

235
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:53,600
celebrity Jeopardy
runner-up Sideshow Bob

236
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:55,792
is in custody again.

237
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,173
Hmm...

238
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:06,240
Next case...

239
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,482
People versus Sideshow Bob.

240
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:10,541
Is the defendant's attorney present?

241
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:11,241
No, your honor.

242
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:12,940
I choose to represent myself.

243
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:14,300
And let me say...

244
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:16,793
I did try to kill the Simpsons.

245
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:17,741
I truly did.

246
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:18,743
Ohhhhhhhhh!

247
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:21,332
Okay, if he doesn't say "but"
right now, we are home free.

248
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:22,213
- But...
- Damn it!

249
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:23,362
I plead not guilty,

250
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:25,060
by reason of insanity!

251
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:28,160
Insanity caused by my persecution

252
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:31,331
at the hands of this young boy.

253
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:32,253
Young?

254
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,880
I'm the oldest kid in my class!

255
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:35,241
By like two years.

256
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,042
For my first witness I call my father,

257
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,871
Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Senior.

258
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,351
Look, that's Sideshow Bob's mother

259
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:42,740
Dame Judith Underdunk!

260
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:45,991
She's the greatest classical
actress of her generation.

261
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:49,112
Dame Judith, you were brilliant
in Troilus and Cressida.

262
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:51,610
Did they name the Toyota
Cressida after the play,

263
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:52,930
or the play after the car?

264
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:55,520
My son is on trial for his life.

265
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:57,892
I'm sorry, I know this
is a terrible time.

266
00:10:57,895 --> 00:10:58,891
So just answer quick.

267
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:00,721
Play first, then car.

268
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,291
I just lost a thousand dollars.

269
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:04,422
Robert was a peaceful boy,

270
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:07,401
sickly and weak from
a congenital heart defect.

271
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:11,871
But then that Simpson boy
started tormenting him,

272
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,111
and he he crossed over
into dementia.

273
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:17,450
To what degree was
this dementia blown?

274
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:18,581
Full.

275
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:21,422
Stop feeling sorry for him!

276
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:23,321
He's a homicidal maniac!

277
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:24,681
He deserves to fry!

278
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:26,863
You see? He knows I'm going
through a rough patch,

279
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:28,283
still he harangues me.

280
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:33,820
Who among you have not suffered

281
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,473
at the hands of this demon scamp

282
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,063
and felt the urge for retribution?

283
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:43,181
He ordered prank pizzas
to 888 Poopy Pants Lane!

284
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,730
Poopy Pants Lane ends
in the 700 block!

285
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:48,932
He mocked my folksy ways!

286
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:51,422
He cheats at Uno!

287
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:58,920
Bob's playing all of you like saps.

288
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,113
This man's a killer!

289
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,172
See how he accuses me
--at my very own trial!

290
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:05,632
I can take no more!

291
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:07,020
I... I...

292
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:09,261
I didn't want to use this,

293
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:11,322
but you've left me no choice.

294
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:14,121
Nitroglycerin!

295
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:15,482
Everybody panic!

296
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:18,383
Yoink!

297
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,793
Foiled again, freak!

298
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,751
You don't understand!

299
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:26,681
I... I...

300
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,453
That nitroglycerin was medicine

301
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:38,672
for Robert's congenital heart
defect.

302
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:41,251
To which my earlier testimony referred.

303
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,543
This man is dead.

304
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,251
And you killed him.

305
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,120
Ew, gross--

306
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:50,591
I'm touching a dead guy!

307
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,510
America has a tradition
of turning outlaws

308
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:59,143
into legends after their deaths:
Billy the Kid,

309
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:01,302
Bonnie and Clyde,
Jesus Christ.

310
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:04,983
Joining them now is
Robert "Sideshow Bob" Terwilliger,

311
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,432
whose funeral we're presenting

312
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:08,270
with live shovel-to-shovel coverage.

313
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,841
And there we see
Bob's grieving parents,

314
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:13,173
his brother, Cecil, left out the
prison for the occasion,

315
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,643
his widow, Francesca,
and his son, Gino.

316
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:20,372
Also in attendance are Bob's colleagues
from the world of clowning.

317
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,521
A veritable who's who ha-ha.

318
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:38,021
<i>Farewell, Sideshow Bob.</i>

319
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:41,581
<i>Your shoes are empty
and the stage is dark</i>

320
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:45,283
<i>Bart stole your nitroglycerin</i>

321
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:48,683
<i>And then your heart infarcked</i>

322
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,493
<i>And it seems to me your loyal fans</i>

323
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:04,123
<i>Oughta buy this DVD</i>

324
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:08,241
<i>Of all your best-loved sketches</i>

325
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:10,632
<i>On The Krusty Show</i>

326
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:15,521
<i>It's full of extra features</i>

327
00:14:16,258 --> 00:14:19,223
<i>And deleted scenes</i>

328
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:23,101
<i>Like when you fell
and split your pants</i>

329
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:27,412
<i>And we saw
your "Frank and Beans."</i>

330
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:39,091
There's the kid
who killed my best friend!

331
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,090
Buy my DVD.

332
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:48,522
Bart, I know this is nuts,
but try to look sad.

333
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:49,672
I'm not sad.

334
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,803
I have nothing to be sad about.
Nothing!

335
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:55,472
Well, I guess the rest of us
should pay our respects.

336
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:58,520
Yeah, well, between you and me,

337
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:00,373
I still can't stand him.

338
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:01,942
<i>I still can't stand him.</i>

339
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:03,402
<i>I still can't stand him.</i>

340
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:04,940
<i>I still can't stand him.</i>

341
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:05,853
<i>I still can't stand him.</i>

342
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:07,603
I don't care
about these church jerks.

343
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,430
<i>Church jerks... church jerks...</i>

344
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:13,213
Homer, your behavior is heinous.

345
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,403
Anus, anus...

346
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,211
anus, anus, anus...

347
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:18,803
Stupid Sideshow Bob.

348
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:20,661
Even when he's dead,
he wrecks my life.

349
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,713
I hope he's in hell
eating a barf burger.

350
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,693
I once felt that way, too.

351
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:26,312
Hey, aren't you Bob's brother?

352
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:27,633
Biologically, yes,

353
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:28,833
but we never got along.

354
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,871
He was always
zigging when I zagged.

355
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,173
That summer when he wanted to tour
the castles of Italy,

356
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:34,863
I wanted to tour
the castles of France.

357
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,321
So we went to Spain,

358
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,563
a compromise that satisfied no one.

359
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:38,703
That's stupid.

360
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,661
You talk like youre smart,
but you're stupid.

361
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,583
Anyway, I choose to remember
Bob as the big brother

362
00:15:43,698 --> 00:15:45,311
who taught me to play Botticelli.

363
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:46,362
Sounds boring.

364
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,501
Oh, you'd love it.

365
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,313
It's a guessing game
in which one

366
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,363
player adopts the guise
of a noteworthy--

367
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:53,090
you're right, it is boring.

368
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:55,822
But the only way
you'll find happiness

369
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,572
is by making your peace with Bob.

370
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,141
Well, I guess I could say good-bye.

371
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:01,181
You'd better make it snappy.

372
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:02,850
They're cremating him in 30 minutes.

373
00:16:02,937 --> 00:16:05,523
I'll be scattering his ashes
over the castles of France.

374
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:08,491
Take that, ashes.

375
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:16,300
Hey, Bart! You're on the
front page of the paper.

376
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,502
I'm going to set things right.
Wanna come with me?

377
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:22,521
I would, but tonight my dad's
taking me to the batting cage.

378
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:24,750
He's gonna teach me to umpire!

379
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,493
Check it out, an official

380
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:28,030
Major Leagueball/strike counter!

381
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:31,500
Ball one, ball two, strike one...

382
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:33,993
Bart? Bart?

383
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,340
Hi, Lisa.

384
00:16:42,538 --> 00:16:44,170
Hate to mix"B" with "P,"

385
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:46,450
but your family owes
me for two weeks.

386
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,243
Milhouse, have you seen Bart?

387
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:49,510
Bart Simpson?

388
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:51,033
I think he went to pay his

389
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,413
respects to Sideshow Bob.

390
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:54,563
Mind if I sit down for a second?

391
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:56,270
My feet are killing me.

392
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:58,713
Feet... killing?!

393
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:00,743
We've got to save Bart!

394
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,821
Now?
But I'm getting a home perm.

395
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:03,692
Now!

396
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,701
Bob, it's me, Bart.

397
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:14,531
I came here to tell you
I never meant for you to die.

398
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,263
I just wanted you to go to jail
and get beat up a lot.

399
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:19,483
Now everyone wishes I was dead.

400
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:22,931
Then let's give the people
what they want!

401
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,253
Sideshow Bob!

402
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:45,953
Bob planned this
from the beginning.

403
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:47,613
He wanted to be captured
at the restaurant.

404
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,493
He would never get
a Shakespeare quote wrong.

405
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:50,070
No.

406
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:51,701
His mother was a Shakespearian actress.

407
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:54,323
- His father is a doctor.
- A doctor, huh?

408
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,462
So when Bob collapsed in the courtroom...

409
00:17:56,468 --> 00:17:56,991
I remember.

410
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,642
...his father could take that

411
00:17:58,648 --> 00:17:59,922
opportunity to inject Bob

412
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,682
with a powerful drug
that simulated death.

413
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:05,230
It was a diabolical scheme, and every

414
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:07,160
member of his family played a part!

415
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,450
Are you done? 'Cause I've been
circling the funeral home

416
00:18:09,577 --> 00:18:10,752
- for ten minutes.
- Yes.

417
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:17,802
Cool, I found a trapdoor that
leads to an underground city.

418
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:19,920
Here I go!

419
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,252
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

420
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:29,363
- Are you buying this?
- When they find your ashes,

421
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,041
they'll think it's me.

422
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:33,950
And I'll be far away
with my loving family.

423
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:35,881
It's the perfect crime.

424
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:37,891
And it was my flawless performance

425
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:40,280
as the grieving brother
that sealed the deal.

426
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:43,190
Yes, and Hamlet is all about Laertes.

427
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,410
Would you please stop
comparing me to Laertes!

428
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:48,571
If the doublet fits...

429
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:56,021
Stop that cremation!

430
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,391
Hey, what smells so good?

431
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,573
Zeus' pimples!

432
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,032
Hot! Hot! Hot!

433
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,450
You're too late, Simpsons!

434
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,181
Eat hobo remains!

435
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:13,602
Get me out of here!

436
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,202
What are you doing?
I can't breathe!

437
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:19,482
Marge, he's got to get
over his fear of coffins.

438
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,803
Freeze, Sideshow Snobs!

439
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,023
You're all under arrest.

440
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:29,723
You have the right to remain silent,
but I hope you don't.

441
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,430
It's a long way to jail
and I like to chitchat.

442
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:36,062
Wait, I must know.

443
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:37,933
How did you loosen the tiles

444
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:39,302
of my mosaic of murder?

445
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,931
I grew suspicious
when I saw the casket

446
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,582
had extra room
built-in for your feet.

447
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:46,581
Why would your family pay all

448
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,420
that extra money of a dead man?

449
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:52,413
Damn these glorious gunboats!

450
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:54,340
Nice try, Bob,

451
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:56,381
but you didn't count on one thing.

452
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:59,380
- What's that?
- You stink like my butt!

453
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:01,903
Take him away!

454
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:06,313
Oh, why must I feed him
straight lines?!

455
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:13,822
Well, this time I think Sideshow Bob

456
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:16,013
is finally locked up for good.

457
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:17,663
Yeah, the only thing that's

458
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,352
going to be hacked to pieces now

459
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,233
is this celebratory cake!

460
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:26,153
So who wants a nice big slice?

461
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:27,831
Slash!

462
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,320
Hack! Die!

463
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:38,332
There he goes again.

464
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,670
You have 87 years to get
used to it, Father.

465
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:43,790
East bids two hearts.

466
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:44,790
Three diamonds.

467
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,131
Three clubs.

468
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:51,363
The joke's not funny
and the bid's not sufficient.
