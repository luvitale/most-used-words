The Simpsons S19E10 (KABF03)
E. Pluribus Wiggum

2
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,713
Come on, Mr. Burns,
keep moving.

3
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:59,240
We can't leave work till you do.

4
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,135
Aw, no.

5
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:04,606
He's talking to
that mailroom guy.

6
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,072
I hope he's not telling
that stupid story

7
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:07,883
about hang gliding again.

8
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:12,048
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

9
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:18,946
Listen carefully.

10
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,590
I have taken your wife hostage.

11
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:21,732
If you don't have a wife,

12
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,151
I have kidnapped your brother.

13
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:24,579
Nod if you understand.

14
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:27,500
Now back away from Burns

15
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,502
and I will let your dog live.

16
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:32,722
Good.

17
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:35,872
Now stop and dance
like a happy prospector.

18
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,271
Happier.

19
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,551
Happier!

20
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:43,760
Happier!

21
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:49,073
Homer, we want to get him
away from Burns.

22
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:49,871
Oh, right.

23
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:50,680
Just leave.

24
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:51,892
But kick like
a Rockette.

25
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:02,261
- Woo!
- Yes!

26
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:03,223
We're free!

27
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:05,180
Empty apartment
here I come!

28
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:06,812
Set the table, Marge.

29
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:07,891
I can already taste

30
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,543
those deep-fried pork chops.

31
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,502
Don't you remember what today is?

32
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:13,251
When you ask me that

33
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:14,562
it's never good.

34
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:16,092
It's the first
of the month.

35
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,551
The day you promised
to start your new diet.

36
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,870
I'm just really worried
about your weight.

37
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:24,312
Bart says that we got a call from NASA,

38
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:26,063
and your gravity is pulling

39
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,931
satellites out of their orbits.

40
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:29,621
Marge, that was a joke.

41
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,283
But it comes from
a true place.

42
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:33,092
Oh!

43
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:35,343
Well, if I'm going
to start a diet,

44
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:36,763
this is my last chance

45
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:38,920
to eat all the crap I love.

46
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:47,153
I think I'll miss
you most of all,

47
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:49,480
Captain Corn Dog
Schnitzel Palace.

48
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:51,081
No tears, Homer.

49
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,210
<i>I'm lost in a crowd</i>

50
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:58,050
<i>And I'm hungry
like the wolf</i>

51
00:03:58,178 --> 00:03:59,831
<i>Straddle the line,</i>

52
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:01,920
<i>in discord and rhyme</i>

53
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:06,293
<i>And I'm hungry
like the wolf.</i>

54
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:12,003
Can't let Marge see this.

55
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:13,390
Thank you!

56
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:16,561
A drive-up trash can.

57
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,383
This must be how the rich

58
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,090
toss out their gold.

59
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,560
And as long as I'm cleaning out

60
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:22,923
the family chariot...

61
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:24,463
Cups...

62
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:26,012
newspapers...

63
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:27,602
bottles...

64
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:29,433
tricycle...

65
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:31,391
lawn chair...

66
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:33,451
un-cashed checks.

67
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:38,842
Hmm, "Dispose of properly."

68
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:40,611
Aw, this book is too hard.

69
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:48,641
And now for a victory cigar.

70
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:54,873
Thank you!

71
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:06,313
<i>And I'm hungry
like the wolf.</i>

72
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:15,991
The calamity in our Fast-Food District

73
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:17,871
destroyed 37 restaurants rated

74
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,191
"awful" to "mediocre."

75
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,320
And put these beloved

76
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:22,091
mascots out on the street.

77
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:24,810
I told myself

78
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:26,370
I'd stay strong.

79
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:30,643
There, there,
Cheesy McMayor.

80
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,450
No one likes weepy meat.

81
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,903
I can't stand to see a

82
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:35,303
grown burger cry.

83
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,560
We must rebuild

84
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,320
Fast Food Boulevard!

85
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:41,162
I don't know about you,

86
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,740
but I don't want to
live in a future

87
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,551
where food is brought by

88
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:45,922
"waiters..."

89
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:47,071
where the chairs aren't

90
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:48,590
attached to the tables...

91
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,480
and where I can't ditch my kids

92
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:52,441
in a pit of dirty balls.

93
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:54,333
I say we rebuild the

94
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:55,541
Fast-Food District

95
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,731
bigger and better than ever!

96
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,530
To raise the money,
we'll need a bond issue.

97
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:02,610
But won't that just shift

98
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,240
the burden to your children?

99
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:05,413
No, you idiot.

100
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:06,412
We just pay for it with

101
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:07,811
another bond issue.

102
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:10,163
Let her figure out
someone to dump it on.

103
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:12,921
Then it's decided

104
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:14,930
the bond issue will be part of our next

105
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:15,943
scheduled election,

106
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,250
the Springfield presidential primary.

107
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,782
But that's not till next June.

108
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:21,751
In that case, I hereby move

109
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,063
the election up to next Tuesday.

110
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,732
That means the Springfield presidential

111
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,751
primary will be first in the nation.

112
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,592
Even earlier than New Hampshire.

113
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:32,321
Uh-oh,

114
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,431
they're going to be cheesed.

115
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:38,651
Providing cheap liquor to
Massachusetts teens for 200 years.

116
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:43,020
As they day of the primary nears,

117
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,032
this race is as wide open as a

118
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:47,290
hobo's mouthat a pie-flinging contest.

119
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,793
What do you New Hampshirites think

120
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,021
of the current crop of
presidential candidates?

121
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,872
Well, Mr. Rather,

122
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,131
the way I see it,

123
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:56,281
as my father always said,

124
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,531
"The way I look at it..."

125
00:06:57,537 --> 00:06:58,662
Dan, breaking news.

126
00:06:58,665 --> 00:06:59,843
Springfield just moved its primary

127
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,193
a week ahead of New Hampshire's.

128
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:02,392
Now it's the first one.

129
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:03,730
Sweet mother of Murrow.

130
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,761
off to Springfield, people.

131
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:06,981
Come on, folks, move it.

132
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:08,953
Grandma was slow, but she was old.

133
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,153
You have no excuse.

134
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:11,022
Into the truck!

135
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:18,163
To Springfield.

136
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,311
Which Springfield?

137
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:20,613
The one the Simpsons live in.

138
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:23,303
Eh, looks like everyone's gone

139
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,640
but the cashier.

140
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,483
Time to make our move.

141
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:31,283
Nice knitting on these masks, Martha.

142
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,093
Now that you've said my name

143
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:34,480
I have to kill him.

144
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,222
With Springfield's primary
now first in the nation,

145
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:04,501
our humble city is
overrun with candidates,

146
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:07,259
newshounds, spin doctors,
hacks, flacks, Russerts,

147
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,812
Blitzers and even the occasional voter.

148
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,002
Sir, do you have a preference?

149
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,490
Yeah, I like girls, fruit loop.

150
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:14,692
Are you a registered voter?

151
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:15,782
I'm a registered...

152
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,512
something.

153
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:20,160
This election is on every channel.

154
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:20,961
Come on, Marge.

155
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,400
It's primary fever.

156
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:23,021
Catch it!

157
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,761
That's what you said about yellow fever,

158
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,002
and that was no fun.

159
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,933
I think it's exciting,
Springfield is the

160
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:29,691
center of the political universe.

161
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:31,771
I feel like a pundit in a think tank!

162
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,471
Think tank, eh?

163
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:34,503
Hmm.

164
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,831
Now let's consider World Bank lending

165
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:39,603
policy towards Micronesia.

166
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:43,303
What?

167
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,942
I'm not allowed to get one right?

168
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,083
I like you newsies.

169
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:52,150
You really lap up the sauce.

170
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,113
Do you have Internet access?

171
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:55,461
Sure thing, mouse pad.

172
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:56,391
Ten bucks.

173
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:04,423
Knock yourself out.

174
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:09,272
This is Jon Stewart
reporting from Springfield.

175
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:10,670
Do I need to say my name?

176
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:11,862
People know me, right?

177
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:13,183
Know it's just cable, but...

178
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:14,132
You know what?

179
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,111
I'm not gonna worry about it.

180
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:15,831
I gonna just...

181
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:18,831
Great. Now I'm worried.

182
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:21,101
Hey, hey,it's Jon Stewart,

183
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:23,870
everyone's favorite political funnyman!

184
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:25,292
Hey, Krusty!

185
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,371
Haven't seen you since
you bailed on that benefit.

186
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:29,323
Yeah, well, I really didn't

187
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:30,933
believe in the cause.

188
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,361
Well, Krusty's Kids sure missed ya.

189
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,793
Yeah, they're great.

190
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:36,843
A little clingy...

191
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:37,491
But anyway,

192
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:39,743
this Springfield primary election

193
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,340
pretty crazy, huh?

194
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:42,452
Yeah, it sure is.

195
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,081
With many comic
elements, such as, uh...?

196
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,761
You know, if you ask me...

197
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:50,840
there's more hot air
here than there is at...

198
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:52,830
Are you writing this down?

199
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:54,262
Nah, this is somethin' else.

200
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:55,092
So, uh,

201
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:58,133
where is there less
hot air than here?

202
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,450
Albuquerque Balloon Festival?

203
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,973
Rush Limbaugh' s sweatpants?

204
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:03,620
Krusty,

205
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,353
you're obviously fishing for jokes so

206
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:06,563
you can steal them.

207
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,290
No!

208
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:09,440
That's ridiculous!

209
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:11,313
More ridiculous than that place

210
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,081
with all the hot air,

211
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:14,020
which is...

212
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,722
Well, I'll thank you to keep

213
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,801
my zingers out of your mouth.

214
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:18,861
I'm gonna try and remember you

215
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,651
the way you used to be.

216
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:23,111
But I've always been terrible!

217
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,821
With me here to comment on today's

218
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,423
Democratic debate is
Andrea Crowney of CNN,

219
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,810
Dumont Evans of Slate.com

220
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:32,963
and Ron Lehar,

221
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,430
a print journalist

222
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,152
from the Washington Post.

223
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:39,441
Your medium is dying!

224
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:40,172
Nelson!

225
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,342
But it is!

226
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:43,500
There's being right,
and there's being nice.

227
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:51,191
Thank you all for coming
to our focus group.

228
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:53,182
Today we're going to show you commercial

229
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,963
from the Republican candidates.

230
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:56,853
We'd like your honest opinions.

231
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,511
This punch is too sweet.

232
00:10:58,515 --> 00:11:00,242
your blouse makes you look fat.

233
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:02,053
Opinions about the ads.

234
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,382
I live in that place!

235
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:08,441
Who should America elect in 2008?

236
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:10,642
<i>Former governor Vincent Aleppo</i>

237
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:11,991
<i>said in the New York Times,</i>

238
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:14,283
<i>"I will protect the nation
from attack."</i>

239
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:15,493
<i>He's got my vote.</i>

240
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:18,623
<i>But in that same issue
of the New York Times,</i>

241
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:20,742
<i>they also printed an article about</i>

242
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,782
<i>terrorist leader
Nussaf Al Mustaffi.</i>

243
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,601
Dear God, what have I done?

244
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,081
<i>"And you shall judge them</i>

245
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,153
<i>by the company they keep."</i>

246
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,612
Mm, my god!

247
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,942
They're going steady!

248
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,450
Did everyone see that?!

249
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:44,700
So, what do we think?

250
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:46,472
Well, I thought every part
of it was good,

251
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:47,551
but overall, I hated it.

252
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:49,211
I feel exactly the opposite,

253
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:49,943
but the same.

254
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,502
That was the best milkshake

255
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,873
ad I've ever seen.

256
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,262
It makes me wanna
want a milkshake!

257
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,783
The top fifth is consuming

258
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:02,322
60% of our nation's ressources

259
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:04,351
while the bottom two-fifths

260
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:06,253
is consuming one eighth.

261
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:08,163
Hence my campaign slogan,

262
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,523
"End quintile disparity".

263
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,122
Look, we all care about

264
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,630
quintile disparity,

265
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:15,370
but the Democrats can't win

266
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:17,090
with another prissy brainiac.

267
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:18,851
Thank you, Senator Winnergill.

268
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,350
That's Whiner-girl.

269
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,052
Honey, how many of this signs

270
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,402
do I have to put up?

271
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:37,252
25 more?!

272
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,303
What did I ever do to
you to deserve this?

273
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:44,823
You're never gonna
let that go, are you?

274
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:46,913
Oh, my god!

275
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,431
That family is undecided!

276
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:50,693
Undecided!

277
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:10,251
I wonder who that could be...

278
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:17,031
Family values!

279
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:18,223
Vanishing middle class!

280
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:18,993
Cut and run!

281
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:21,392
Terrorists win! Terrorists win!

282
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:23,251
Stop all this pandering!

283
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:24,743
If you haven't sprung from her

284
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,251
or aren't married to my loins,

285
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:28,033
get the hell out
of this house!

286
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,333
You too, Fred Thompson.

287
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:36,963
But I was in Die Hard.

288
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:39,183
Die Hard Two!

289
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:46,643
Is everyone here
as sick of those

290
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,430
stupid politicians as I am?

291
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:50,662
What about the media?

292
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:51,992
They're not covering the issues.

293
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:53,692
They just want to declare
a frontrunner

294
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,152
and go back to their mansions.

295
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:58,451
Who wants to abolish
democracy forever?

296
00:13:58,455 --> 00:13:59,282
Show of hands.

297
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:00,530
I could really go for some

298
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:01,883
kind of military dictator

299
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:03,381
like, uh, Juan Peron.

300
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,501
When he disappeared ya,

301
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:05,850
you stayed disappeared.

302
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:07,232
Plus his wife was Madonna.

303
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:08,570
What are we gonna do?

304
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:09,932
We can't not vote,

305
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:11,282
nobody does that.

306
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,040
Why don't we all pick the most

307
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:15,543
ridiculous candidate
and write him in?

308
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:17,123
You mean Dennis Kucinich?

309
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:19,060
Hey! I'm right here!

310
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:19,952
Oh, sorry.

311
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,073
No, no. This candidate has to

312
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,743
be unbelievably ridiculous.

313
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:24,741
Chief Wiggum!

314
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:25,840
No.

315
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,592
But you're close.

316
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:29,350
Roll over, Anne Coulter,

317
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:31,520
and tell James Carville the news:

318
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:32,691
Springfield voters have

319
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:33,852
overwhelmingly rejected

320
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,502
the major candidates of both parties

321
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,971
in favor of a write-in:

322
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,182
eight-year-old Ralph Wiggum.

323
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:41,273
Shockingly, this new face is now favored

324
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,671
by 53% of likely voters.

325
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:46,031
A new frontrunner has been crowned!

326
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:50,643
What I did made the TV thing happen.

327
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,031
<i>Live from our nation's capitol,</i>

328
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,733
<i>this is Headbutt with Nash Castor.</i>

329
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:08,543
Our top story:

330
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:10,353
President Ralph Wiggum?

331
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,730
Two days ago, this
bed-wetter made a splash

332
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:14,870
in the Springfield Primary.

333
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,863
With the remaining 49 primaries

334
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,321
scheduled for next Tuesday,

335
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:20,722
can Ralph go from Sesame Street

336
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,333
to Pennsylvania Avenue?

337
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,200
Adriatica Vel Johnson!

338
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,281
Well, Nash,

339
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:27,553
Ralph Wiggum is a breath of fresh air for

340
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,641
a country hungry for a change of air.

341
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:31,991
And he's already a master
of the sound bite,

342
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,220
from take on immigration reform...

343
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,500
Stranger danger!

344
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:38,152
...to his disciplined stance
on government spending.

345
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,371
I only have this much monies.

346
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:44,873
Well, um, I'd hate to be the
fingernail in this Cobb salad,

347
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,681
but we don't even know
if this young man

348
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:48,390
is a Democrat or Republican.

349
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:50,993
Before we invite
Ralph to the prom,

350
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:52,290
we should find out if he's

351
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:54,723
wearing a tux or a tutu.

352
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:59,042
Mom, they're taking Ralph's
candidacy seriously.

353
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,511
This is a disaster!

354
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,171
Speaking of disasters,

355
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:03,582
have you seen this?

356
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:06,681
Springfield Dodge bought
too much inventory,

357
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:08,221
and they've only got one weekend

358
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:10,570
to get rid of all the '07s.

359
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:16,343
Lisa, I'm sure this Wiggum-arole
will blow over.

360
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:17,673
You have to have faith in

361
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,513
the wisdom of the average voter.

362
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:20,682
I dig the Wig!

363
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:21,940
I dig the Wig!

364
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,291
Oh, dear God...

365
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,771
Come on, Lis, hop on
the Wiggum Wagon.

366
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:26,872
Ralph said he'd let me be

367
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:28,091
Secretary of Indian burns.

368
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,681
Here's my first official act:

369
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:31,161
Ow!

370
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:33,181
Ralph can't be president.

371
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:36,192
He's the dumbest person,
in the slowest reading group.

372
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,632
Lisa, being president is easy.

373
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,883
You just point the Army and shoot.

374
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:42,321
And Ralph is only eight years old.

375
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:45,030
It says in the Constitution,
you have to be 35.

376
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:46,392
The Constitution?

377
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:48,591
I'm pretty sure the
Patriot Act killed it

378
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:49,780
to ensure our freedoms.

379
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:52,282
Oh, the Patriot Act
is so terrible!

380
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:53,531
The government might find out

381
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:55,713
what library books I take out.

382
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:56,330
What's next?

383
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:58,423
Finding out what operas I go to?

384
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,052
So it's agreed:

385
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:02,962
we cancel the rest of
the primaries and offer

386
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,960
the G.O.P. nomination
to this knee-high want-wit.

387
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:08,173
My oil rig is already gushin' for

388
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:09,513
this Wiggum critter!

389
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:11,460
Do you have bats in your belfry?

390
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:14,120
They don't even let him
use big-boy scissors!

391
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,982
Sure he's a little green, but, uh,

392
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:17,462
you know, so was George W. Bush,

393
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:20,012
and look how great, uh,he-he... um...

394
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:21,992
But at least he won!

395
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:23,050
The second time...

396
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:26,592
assuming they don't find
those ballot boxes in Ohio.

397
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:30,051
Look, the Wiggum boy's better
than anyone else we've got.

398
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:30,912
Hear! Hear!

399
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,192
Well, if you put it that way...

400
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:39,823
This meeting of the Democratic Party

401
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,592
will come to order, babies.

402
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:44,161
So if we nominate this
Ralph Wiggums,

403
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:47,080
we will be likean
unstoppable choo-choo.

404
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:49,213
I already got my assless,

405
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:51,662
sparkle tux cleaned
for the inauguration.

406
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:53,661
I agree with my ex-husband.

407
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,952
With Ralph on the ticket,

408
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,833
I don't know how we will blow it,

409
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:57,903
but we will.

410
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:00,862
Because that's what the
Democratic Party is all about.

411
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:01,752
- Yeah.
- Yes.

412
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:05,881
This is Kent Brockman reporting

413
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:06,841
from the Wiggum compound,

414
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,691
where both parties have
gathered to court

415
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,510
the most charismatic child since

416
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,412
Drew Barrymore in Firestarter.

417
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,903
When she got mad,
they got burned.

418
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:19,800
Ralph, both parties want

419
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:21,173
to offer you their nomination.

420
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,031
Whom do you like?

421
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:24,662
Go ahead, Ralphie.

422
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,211
You're invited to two parties

423
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,343
one with a donkey
and one with an elephant.

424
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,250
Who do you like?

425
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:31,852
Elmo?

426
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,742
Ah, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt,

427
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,502
Richard Nixon's chief
of naval operations.

428
00:18:35,508 --> 00:18:37,291
So Ralph's a Republican!

429
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:38,441
Not so fast, Kent.

430
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,601
Zumwalt ran for the senatein '76

431
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:41,522
as a Democrat.

432
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:42,950
No way, Lou

433
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,991
you're thinking of
Admiral Hyman Rickover.

434
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:46,691
The father of the Nuclear Navy?

435
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:47,700
As if!

436
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,443
Only one place to settle this :

437
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,933
to the offices of the
World Book Encyclopedia!

438
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:56,673
Ralph!

439
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:57,441
Ralph!

440
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:58,153
Ralph!

441
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:06,620
Ralph, darling, be a Democrat.

442
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,112
We have Alec Baldwin,

443
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:09,871
they have Stephen Baldwin.

444
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:12,292
They might as well not
even have a Baldwin.

445
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,591
Leave him alone,
you vultures!

446
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:15,582
Who are you?

447
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:18,050
Ralph and I used to date.

448
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:20,021
Nice.

449
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,133
Now maybe you can
help him pick a party.

450
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:26,200
Ralph, they have no
right to do this to you.

451
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:27,770
They just want to use you.

452
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,721
Maybe I want to use them.

453
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:31,862
Maybe you wha...?!

454
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:34,352
Use them to make this
country great again.

455
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:36,871
When we're mad,
we'll just use our words,

456
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,570
then the rest of the world
will play nice with us.

457
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:42,451
And the only boom-booms
will be in our pants.

458
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:45,341
Maybe you wouldn't be
such a bad president.

459
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:47,710
And you can be my first ladle.

460
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:49,140
I like the sound of that.

461
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:49,762
Ralph!

462
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,653
Ralph!

463
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:51,342
Ralph!

464
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:52,592
Ralph!!

465
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,373
Ralph!!!

466
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,153
Ralph!!!

467
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:55,793
<i>The following is a paid
political announcement</i>

468
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,210
<i>by the Republican and Democratic parties.</i>

469
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:06,552
<i>These are all words</i>

470
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,471
<i>Ralph Wiggum doesn't know;</i>

471
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,312
<i>but he doesn't need to know them,</i>

472
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:12,580
<i>he lives them, every day.</i>

473
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:13,990
I'm voting Ralph for president.

474
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:16,561
His easy smile makes me
think everything is okay,

475
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:17,780
even when I know it ain't.

476
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,341
I'm voting for Ralph, too.

477
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,150
But don't tell you-know-who.

478
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:23,500
<i>On November 4th,</i>

479
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,762
<i>vote for the latest in a long line</i>

480
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:28,051
<i>of great American leaders.</i>

481
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,300
I want a tricycle,

482
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,983
and a dog who won't chew my Hot Wheels,

483
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:35,300
and a brighter future for America!

484
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,453
I'm Ralph Wiggum,

485
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:38,223
and I've been a good boy!
