1
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:08,487
The Simpsons S19E19 (KABF12)
Mona Leaves-a

2
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:16,260
This punishment is not medieval.

3
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:44,835
Hey.

4
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:59,145
What took you so long?

5
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,198
Excuse me.

6
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,257
- Are you leaving?
- No, sorry.

7
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:18,018
I'm not leaving.

8
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,266
Sorry, not leaving.

9
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,336
Not quite yet.

10
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:24,180
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:25,942
I'm not leaving.

12
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,264
So what are you doing?

13
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:28,983
Oh, I like creating disappointment.

14
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:31,213
You know that little moment
where people's hope dies?

15
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:32,492
I feed on that.

16
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:35,713
Uh, is this space free?

17
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:37,161
You know as a matter of fact...

18
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:38,322
it ain't!

19
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,403
Ahh, that's heavenly.

20
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:42,772
Sweaters, not
the fun cartoon

21
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:49,752
Mom, you tricked us!

22
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:52,180
We thought this was going
to be a fun trip to the mall!

23
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:54,703
We listed to music radio
in the car.

24
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,051
And since you kids behaved,

25
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:59,430
we'll pick one fun thing
to do here.

26
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:01,513
I want to go lecture the
food court businesses

27
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:03,502
that are still using Styrofoam.

28
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,663
Lead-based toys!
Lead-based toys!

29
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,373
Sit on a bench!
Sit on a bench!

30
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:13,203
For once, we'll do what
Maggie wants.

31
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,952
Oh, Maggie's thing?

32
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,172
She won't even remember
that we did it!

33
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:22,923
None of you kids ever remember any

34
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,620
of the nice things we do for you.

35
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,102
- Like what?
- Food.

36
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:27,283
- Pass.
- Shelter?

37
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:28,812
- That dump?!
- Clothing?

38
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:30,900
I wouldn't blow my nose into this.

39
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,333
Welcome to Stuff-N-Hug,

40
00:03:37,337 --> 00:03:38,940
a Funworks Lovelab!

41
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:41,463
I'm used to buying
my critters pre-made.

42
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:43,242
How does your store differ?

43
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:44,610
Why should I tell you,

44
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:47,021
when we've got a video
that shows you!

45
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:52,023
Video's broken, Alan!

46
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:53,060
Call Eric!

47
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,103
I'm Eric!

48
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,400
Black Eric!

49
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,840
I want a poodle.

50
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,713
I'd stay away from poodles.

51
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:01,053
They give the dog...

52
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,620
ideas.

53
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,923
How much love do you want
in your Stuff-N-Hug?

54
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:09,822
I want all the love.

55
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,980
Snow day!

56
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:19,741
So little girl,

57
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,481
what outfit do you want
for your dolphin?

58
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:23,411
- Doctor.
- Okay...

59
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:24,700
nurse it is.

60
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:25,710
Professor.

61
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,261
- Kindergarten teacher.
- Chef!

62
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,583
- Lunch lady!
- CEO!

63
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:30,741
Secretary to a CEO.

64
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:33,172
You know,
it's a boy dolphin.

65
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,391
Oh...

66
00:04:34,397 --> 00:04:36,950
here you go, Doctor.

67
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,381
We fooled her...

68
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,521
Betsy.

69
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:46,430
Bart is awesome.

70
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,362
Bart is awesome.

71
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:51,043
Wow, this guy could put
Milhouse out of business.

72
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:53,933
Oh,

73
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,882
well, this is kind
of a cute outfit.

74
00:04:58,627 --> 00:04:59,850
Homer is a lard butt.

75
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,921
- What did you say?
- Homer has booger breath.

76
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:04,543
- It's a medical condition!
- Homer is a big jerk.

77
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:06,263
Who told you these
things about me?

78
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:07,643
Dung muncher.
Stink brains.

79
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:08,983
Cheese wang.
Captain Crud.

80
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,840
I don't want to get mad,
but I will!

81
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,140
B.O. Baracus. Mount Baldy.

82
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:13,602
Tub of Guts.
Crapper Clogger.

83
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:14,580
Oh, that's it!

84
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:16,552
Uh, Mom, we got a code four.

85
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:20,710
I'll kill you all!

86
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,772
It didn't have
to go down like this!

87
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,643
The door's open!

88
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,180
I think someone broke in!

89
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:37,062
Don't worry.
I'm ready for this.

90
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,383
Bart, fetch "The Defender."

91
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:40,441
Yes, sir!

92
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,743
I hear noises coming
from the kitchen.

93
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:56,611
Uh-oh, that's where
the food sleeps.

94
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,571
Wait a minute.

95
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:06,153
I smell apples, cinnamon,.......

96
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:07,480
crust.

97
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:08,802
It's a pie!

98
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,692
Why would a robber make pie?

99
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,001
Who cares?

100
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:14,672
If you kill him,
we'll be on TV!

101
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:15,672
You're right, boy!

102
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,153
Hmm? Mom!

103
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,223
My aquarium!

104
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,331
Hello, Homer.

105
00:06:24,337 --> 00:06:25,451
You're alive!

106
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:26,910
And you baked a pie!

107
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,770
Homie, what's going on?

108
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:30,060
I'm fighting the robber!

109
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,183
You go get ice cream!

110
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,192
Mom, I can't believe
you're here.

111
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:34,390
You keep disappearing and

112
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,883
reappearing and it's not funny.

113
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,852
You're just like that show Scrubs.

114
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:41,082
Homer, I'm sorry I had
to pretend to be dead.

115
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:44,771
But it worked because the government
isn't looking for me anymore.

116
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:48,531
I can finally stop running
and be your mom.

117
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,040
No, thanks.

118
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,211
What do you mean?

119
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:56,350
Every time you go,
I feel abandoned.

120
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:57,523
But not this time.

121
00:06:57,526 --> 00:07:00,262
I'm not gonna let myself get hurt.

122
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:04,381
Homer, I'm through protesting
and chaining myself to things.

123
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:06,651
I've realized that
the most important

124
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,591
thing in my life is you.

125
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:09,991
That's what your mouth says,

126
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,761
but my ears are too smart
to believe it.

127
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,932
In fact, I don't even
want your pie.

128
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:16,603
You already ate
the whole thing.

129
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:19,570
Well, I'm not going
to digest it!

130
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:30,481
Wow, Dad was so cute as a baby.

131
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,151
When did he lose his cuteness?

132
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:35,212
Oh, I have a picture
of that right here.

133
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:43,072
I do feel bad for missing so much
of Homer's childhood.

134
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:45,361
But at least he wasn't raised
by a television.

135
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,070
See you later, honey.

136
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:53,042
Mommy has to go chain herself
to a nuclear submarine.

137
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:54,383
Hugs and kisses!

138
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:09,992
You left a hole in heart
that could never be filled.

139
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:11,970
So I filled it with food.

140
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,042
But I'm never full.

141
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,672
Welcome back to the ESPY Awards.

142
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,192

144
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,302
Wokka, wokka, wokka!

145
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,084
That's right, Fozzie,

Under Pressure Award goes to...

148
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,320
Hey, Lance, nice trousers.

149
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,383
Did you win those
at the Tour de Pants?

150
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,383
Wokka, wokka!

151
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:34,482
Yeah, well, I never thought
you were funny.

152
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:35,520
Ever.

153
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:37,003
Wokka, wokka!

154
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:38,920
Wokka, wokka?

155
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:40,440
Anyway,...

156
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:41,910
the Right Guard Keeping Cool

157
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,492
Under Pressure Award goes to...

158
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,010
Oh, I don't even care.

159
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,020
Homer?

160
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:48,593
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

161
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,282
It's my feelings that are mad.

162
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:53,013
Oh, sweetheart, when I left you,
it was because

163
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:56,033
I thought I could make
the world a little bit better.

164
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:59,723
Maybe all I did was make
my own world a lot worse.

165
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,803
I only hope you
can forgive me.

166
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,352
No!
I can't forgive you.

167
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:05,632
And I don't accept your tuck-in!

168
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:09,633
I understand.

169
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:11,431
These things take time.

170
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:13,951
Good night.

171
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:22,163
Oh, I feel terrible.

172
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:25,320
My own mother reached out to me,
and I rejected her.

173
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:27,020
I'm gonna make her a card.

174
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:30,823
Mom?

175
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:33,750
Are you asleep?

176
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,773
Asleep with your eyes open?

177
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:38,271
Mom?

178
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,062
Mom?!

179
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:48,853
My mother's dead.

180
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:51,570
I'm still with you, son.

181
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:54,612
Oh, this just gets
worse and worse!

182
00:09:55,797 --> 00:10:00,061
After your mother left me, I always
planned to dance on her grave.

183
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:01,853
First, it was gonna be
the Hustle.

184
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,140
Recently, I've been taking
tap lessons.

185
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:05,252
But now?

186
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:08,453
Well, I don't feel
much like dancing.

187
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,723
Come on, Homie.

188
00:10:15,738 --> 00:10:18,803
Your mom wouldn't have wanted
you to stay in bed forever.

189
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,331
I'll tell you what
she didn't want.

190
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:23,351
Me to be a jerk to her
and then she dies.

191
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:26,391
Say something comforting.

192
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:28,772
Okay, comforting,
comforting.

193
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:30,142
Uh, Dad,

194
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,102
whenever I would hang
out with Grandma,

195
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,142
she would always ask me about you.

196
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:35,752
And I'd say you suck.

197
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:38,663
And she would say
you don't suck that bad.

198
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:40,891
She said I didn't suck?

1
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:41,986
That bad.

2
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:43,916
That bad.

3
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,858
- Wow.
- Yeah.

4
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:48,442
Sorry about your ma, Homer.

5
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:51,401
I just wish she hadn't died
thinking I hated her.

6
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:54,227
Yeah, you should always make
peace with your loved ones.

7
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:56,636
I think I'll give my ma
a call right now.

8
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:01,633
Hey, Mom, I just wanted you
to know that you mean...

9
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,988
Yeah, he's here.

10
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:04,320
Hey, Mrs. L.

11
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:06,142
Those butter cookies
you sent were tasty.

12
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:08,004
And the almond ones,
oh!

13
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,513
Aw, I wish I was your son, too.

14
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,201
All right,
I'm gonna pass you back...

15
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,193
Okay, okay, I'll tell him.

16
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:16,910
Uh, Moe, Lenny's mom
says she loves you.

17
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,941
Apu, what do you think happens
after you die?

18
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:24,483
Manjula will sell the store,

19
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:27,111
dye her hair blonde,
and marry my cousin Jangelvar.

20
00:11:27,117 --> 00:11:28,401
Yes, I will.

21
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:31,142
I mean, do you think my mother's
out there somewhere?

22
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:33,981
Does she know I feel bad
about things I said?

23
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,823
Perhaps she's around us now.

24
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:38,422
She may have already
been reincarnated as...

25
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:39,993
that newborn baby or...

26
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:42,081
that tiny mouse
in the nacho cheese.

27
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:44,721
Oh, for crying out loud,
people aren't mice.

28
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:46,410
Oh, what a surprise.

29
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:49,460
Joe Jesus, Junior is going
to set us all straight.

30
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,822
Look, Homer, people don't
come back as anything,

31
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,670
except for our Lord,
who came back as bread.

32
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:55,622
- That's it.
- That's it.

33
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:02,381
That's the thing with your religion:
it's a bummer.

34
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,522
Even the sing-alongs?

35
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,072
No, the sing-alongs are okay.

36
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,150
Homer, look what I found
with your mother's things

37
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:11,953
A donut from the future?

38
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:18,753
The following video was recorded
at Garry's Video Wills.

39
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:22,482
Maggie, that's the same Garry
that filmed your birthday party.

40
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:26,130
Remember,he brought his girlfriend
and they got in a fight?

41
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:27,930
Hello, Homer.

42
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:30,773
If you are watching this right now,
I am dead.

43
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,913
Or if I'm nodead,
you've gotten in to my stuff.

44
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,783
But if I am dead,
this is my will.

45
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,003
And if I'm not,
get out of my stuff.

46
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:40,022
To my grandson Bart,

47
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,470
I leave my Swiss Army knife.

48
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:43,443
Cool.

49
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,010
My dearest Lisa,

50
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:47,801
I leave you a priceless
item so powerful

51
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,223
no government can ever extinguish it:

52
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,153
my rebellious spirit

53
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:54,713
Grandma, I accept your gift.

54
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:57,440
You got nothing,
you got nothing.

55
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:59,643
Marge, I have a purse
for you.

56
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:04,133
It's woven out of nature's
most amazing material: hemp.

57
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:08,560
Hmm, it smells like concerts.

58
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:11,061
And lastly,
for Homer,

59
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:13,643
I leave you something
very special.

60
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:15,840
A difficult task.

61
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:19,721
Go to Springfield Monument Park
and climb to the highest point.

62
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:22,851
At exactly 3:00,
release my ashes.

63
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,060
I love you, Homer.

64
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:27,001
And now,
because they're your favorite,

65
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,303
please enjoy some animal bloopers.

66
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:32,403
Aw, Ma, you always knew just how
to make everything all right.

67
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,723
Oh, it works on so many levels.

68
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,241
Okay, this is it.

69
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:53,580
I've got one last chance to make up
for the things I said to my mom.

70
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:55,750
I will avenge you.

71
00:13:55,757 --> 00:13:57,403
It's not really avenging her, Dad,

72
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:59,251
just the fulfillment
of her last wish.

73
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,370
I'm really glad you
corrected me, Lisa.

74
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,930
People are always really glad
when they're corrected.

75
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:10,480
This is hard work.
Isn't it, boy?

76
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,450
- Boy?
- Hey, Homer!

77
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:15,961
Your butt still looks big
from down here!

78
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,583
Why, you little...!

79
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,973
You know,
spiritually speaking,

80
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:27,842
Grandma's ashes won't know where
they've been thrown from, so...

81
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,290
in a way...

82
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:31,961
I'm lying down now.

83
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,540
I always knew that at the end,

84
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:37,612
it would all come down to me.

85
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:40,632
Excuse me, I think I'm holding
up better than you are.

86
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:43,231
In fact, I've got energy to spare.

87
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,301
Hmm, to spare, eh?

88
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,712
Marge, your back is so sweaty.

89
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:50,260
I'm starting to slip off.

90
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,070
That's the highest point.

91
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:58,561
And only 15 minutes to go.

92
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:24,680
Made it.

93
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:30,501
Mom, we didn't know
each other very well.

94
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:33,833
If we did, you never would have
asked me to climb anything,

95
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,531
but even when you
weren't around,

96
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:39,213
I always felt good knowing
you were out there somewhere.

97
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:42,401
3:00.

98
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:44,500
Good-bye, Mom.

99
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,221
You're finally free.

100
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:50,661
Huh?

101
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:57,132
Guidance system destroyed.

102
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,092
Launch aborted.

103
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,723
Wait a minute.

104
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:07,550
Mom's ashes stopped
that missile launch.

105
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:08,522
Mom.

106
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:12,002
You used me to pull one more
stupid hippie protest.

107
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:13,260
Didn't you?

108
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:16,710
Judging from the wind direction,
distance, time of day,

109
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,352
the ashes must have come from...

110
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:20,280
him.

111
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:24,342
Ugh, ever since you started watching
Monk, you think you are Monk.

112
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:25,172
You're not Monk.

113
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,561
Uh-oh, I got to get
out of here.

114
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,570
I'm stayin' as long as nothing disturbs
this incredibly delicate balance.

115
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,603
You're not supposed
to like it.

116
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:47,451
Show me the law
that says I can't.

117
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:51,292
Are you hurt?

118
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:52,520
I don't think so.

119
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,211
So we got to do that, too.

120
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:07,920
Here's your mother.

121
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,961
You can have her.
To me, she's been nothing but trouble.

122
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,283
What's the delay?

123
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:14,953
Mr. Burns,
we had a saboteur.

124
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:16,690
Well, well, well.

125
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:19,001
Who's this delightful
young lady?

126
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:21,032
She's what held up
the launch, sir.

127
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,660
Pity. You and I could have
shared the world.

128
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,101
You do know you're talking
to a bag of ashes.

129
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:29,631
Hey, I've seen your wife.
She's no Mamie Van Doren.

130
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,690
Just what are you guys up to?

131
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:34,911
Oh, I suppose there's no
harmin telling you.

132
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,532
I'm using the rocket to dispose
of Springfield's nuclear waste

133
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:41,943
by sending it straight to the heart
of the Amazon rainforest.

134
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:44,020
The rainforest?

135
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:45,871
That's that thing Lisa likes.

136
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:49,901
Well, maybe she'll like it better filled
with dying trees and mutated animals.

137
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,290
You monster.

138
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:52,572
On another subject,

139
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:54,450
next Thursday I have
to leave work early.

140
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,992
I assume that's cool.

141
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:58,541
All systems operational.

142
00:17:58,546 --> 00:17:59,782
Excellent.

143
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:05,270
Mom, I'm so sorry.

144
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:08,752
You just wanted to stop one more
senseless act of madness in this world.

145
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:10,084
Well, if I get out of this,

146
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:12,953
I promise you I'll grant
your last wish.

147
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,490
Homer, hey, Homer.

148
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:15,731
Here's Grandma's knife.

149
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:16,962
Toss it down.

150
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:19,832
Thanks, boy.

151
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,321
How am I ever going
to take on all those guys?

152
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,552
Hmm, what could I make
from those two things?

153
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:35,872
Mm... no.

154
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,660
My purse is made of hemp.

155
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:44,543
If we burn it, the silly smoke
will mellow out those guards.

156
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:47,482
We can ignite it with these crystal
earrings Grandma gave me.

157
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:50,012
I thought she gave you
her rebellious spirit.

158
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,102
I found them on her nightstand.

159
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,630
What? Bart got
a Swiss Army knife.

160
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:03,060
<i>One pill makes you larger</i>

161
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:06,003
<i>And one pill makes you small...</i>

162
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:07,951
Hey, did you ever
think about how, like,

163
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:10,820
your fingers are like legs
for your hand?

164
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:13,051
Imagine what cute little
shoes they'd wear.

165
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:15,561
That's already a
thing thimbles, right?

166
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:18,932
God bless America!

167
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:33,561
Send in reinforcements.

168
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:35,392
Actually, you only hired ten.

169
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:36,983
A couple guys called in sick

170
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:39,140
and the Jewish guy
has to leave at sunset.

171
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:40,273
Fine.

172
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:44,720
That'll do, brick.

173
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,103
That'll do.

174
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,602
Base self-destruct
sequence activated.

175
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,091
Detonation in ten,...

176
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,133
nine,...

177
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,291
eight...

178
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:00,441
Homie.

179
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:09,043
Now I'll just add water
to these ashes

180
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,951
and bring my mother back to life.

181
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:13,562
It doesn't work that way, Homie.

182
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:16,531
But she'll live on forever
in what you did today.

183
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:19,121
Well, then, Mom,
this was for you.

184
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,843
<i>No, I would not
give you false hope</i>

185
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:32,691
<i>On this strange
and mournful day</i>

186
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:36,852
<i>But the mother
and child reunion</i>

187
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:40,920
<i>Is only a motion away</i>

188
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:45,131
<i>little darling of mine.</i>

189
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:47,040
More sugar,
more sugar.

190
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:48,941
- No.
- Why not?

191
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,941
Because you're sweet enough.

192
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,252
