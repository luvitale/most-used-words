1
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:08,943
The Simpsons S19E09 (KABF02)
Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind

2
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:16,827
The capital of montana is not "hannah"

3
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:15,377
Nobody steals
Willie's breakfast!

4
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:36,838
I must've really tied one on last night.

5
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:39,238
No more drinking.

6
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,280
6:00 A.M.

7
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,782
Still early enough to sneak

8
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:50,223
into bed and pretend I actually

9
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:52,256
got home at 3:00 A.M.

10
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:53,580
Huh?

11
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,922
Where's Marge?

12
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,774
Hey, kids, have you
seen your mother?

13
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:02,163
Or yourselves?

14
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:05,172
Maggie?!

15
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,483
Has anyone seen anyone?!

16
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:08,551
Oh, of course,

17
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:11,283
they must all be taking a family bath.

18
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:13,173
Without me!

19
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:15,882
Save some suds for...

20
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:17,351
Daddy.

21
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:19,840
Hey, boy know where the family is?

22
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:21,233
Show me on MapQuest.

23
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,793
Fine. Google Maps.

24
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:28,741
What's going on?

25
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:30,271
Why are you attacking me?

26
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:32,641
Look, if this is about me
eating your heart pills,

27
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,370
they shouldn't have made them
in Good 'N' Plenty colors.

28
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:41,291
Moe, my family's gone,
my dog hates me,

29
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:43,242
and I can't remember what happened last night.

30
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:44,172
Was I here?

31
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,160
Was you ever.

32
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:47,992
You came in saying you really
needed to forget something;

33
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,701
so mixed you up the
most powerful drink I got

34
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:52,422
the "Forget-Me-Shot."

35
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,710
A "Forget-Me-Shot?" Never heard of it.

36
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,052
Yeah, that means it worked.

37
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:57,270
No one ever remembers.

38
00:03:57,276 --> 00:04:00,521
That's why I made this video
to explain the process.

39
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,662
You start with a splash
of Jagermeister...

40
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:05,483
- then add sloe gin...
- Got that.

41
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:06,483
- Triple-Sec...
- Right.

42
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,811
- Quadruple-Sec...
- Yeah.

43
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,120
gunk from a dog's eye,

44
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,502
Absolut Pickle...

45
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:11,653
Mmm, pickle.

46
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,330
...the red stripe from Aquafresh,

47
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:15,033
and the funniest ingredient...

48
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:18,011
the venom of the Louisiana Loboto-moth.

49
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:19,833
Come on, sweetie.

50
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,831
You stir it with a
home pregnancy test

51
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,520
till it turns positive...

52
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:29,642
And presto :

53
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,123
the Forget-Me-Shot.

54
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:34,163
Jeez, I don't look like that.

55
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:40,921
The point is,

56
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:43,253
this drink is the
ultimate brain bleacher.

57
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:46,333
One swig wipes out the
last day of your life.

58
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,031
Give me one of those forget-me drinks!

59
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,852
I made a mistake I gotta wipe out.

60
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,532
I was trying to do a
Don Rickles about Arabs,

61
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:55,623
but it turned into a
Mel Gibson about Mexicans.

62
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,401
Huh?

63
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:02,892
What the hell am I doing here?

64
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,962
I gotta get back to
the Latin Grammys.

65
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,213
- There he is! Get him!
- Kill him!

66
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,841
Hot-sauce his eyes!

67
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:13,951
Oh, my God.

68
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,920
Why would I want to wipe out my memory?!

69
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:17,870
What horrible
thing did I do?!

70
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,972
You don't remember, huh?

71
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,323
There was a domestic disturbance
at your address yesterday.

72
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:26,951
Chief Wiggum!

73
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:29,461
I remember seeing you...

74
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,222
What's going on here, Simpson?

75
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,022
Am I gonna need the zip strips?

76
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:37,903
Everything's fine

77
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,962
cupcakes and sprinkles.

78
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:40,702
I see.

79
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,160
And how did you get that?

80
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:43,553
What gives, Simpson?

81
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,203
Giving your wife an Irish kiss?

82
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:46,453
No, I swear!

83
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:48,380
It was my fault. I...

84
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:50,393
I walked into a door.

85
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,830
Walked into a door, huh?

86
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:54,493
That is the lamest excuse I ever...

87
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,172
All right, door!

88
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:57,782
You're coming downtown!

89
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:02,993
Marge had a black eye?

90
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:05,832
I could never do
something like that.

91
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:06,852
Could I?

92
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:08,992
Why don't you ask the person
who filed the complaint?

93
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:11,370
Not that I am authorized to
release that information...

94
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:11,930
Flanders!

95
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:12,983
Fine, it was Flanders.

96
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:14,433
Now, since you know everything,

97
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:15,473
who was Jack the Ripper?

98
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:17,240
The queen's private surgeon!

99
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:21,032
Flanders, why did you
call the cops last night?

100
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,150
I had to--I heard a hubbub, Bub.

101
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:25,312
What did I do?!

102
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,531
I can't say for sure,
but as a Christian,

103
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,083
I assume the worst.

104
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:32,563
What happened in this room?!

105
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,470
If only these walls could talk.

106
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,893
People would pay to come
see my amazing talking walls,

107
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,651
and I could use that money to...

108
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:41,202
Hey, a memory!

109
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:46,850
Stop! Homer, please!

110
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:49,393
My eye!

111
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:54,030
No, it can't be!

112
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,543
I would never hurt Marge!

113
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:56,842
I'm a good man!

114
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:58,581
Yeah, yeah, me too!

115
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:03,132
You know, doing this
is just confirming a

116
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:04,943
stereotype for you Mexicans.

117
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:06,503
I am from Costa Rica!

118
00:07:06,507 --> 00:07:08,022
And I should care because?

119
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:15,093
Thank goodness you
come to visit me, son!

120
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:17,753
I can't take one more
minute of this high school

121
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:20,131
glee club pretending they
don't hate being here.

122
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,423
Oh, what a night

123
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:26,960
<i>You know I didn't even know her name</i>

124
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:31,653
<i>But I was never gonna be the same</i>

125
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:35,461
<i>What a lady
What a night...</i>

126
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:40,011
You'll eat our cookies,
but you won't look at us!

127
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:43,600
Dad, I can't remember
what I did last night.

128
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,230
Do you have any idea?

129
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:48,030
You come to me
for help rememberin'?

130
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:50,622
That's like asking your
horse to do your taxes,

131
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,902
which I did back in 1998.

132
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:55,750
I'm afraid I did something

133
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:57,672
to make Marge and the kids leave me.

134
00:07:57,736 --> 00:07:58,353
Wait.

135
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,213
I know someone who can help you

136
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:03,600
a doctor who helps people
dig up old memories.

137
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:04,302
Really?

138
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,673
Oh, that's great, Dad.

139
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,282
How can I ever repay you?

140
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,923
Punch that orderly who takes

141
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:10,390
sips out of my juice.

142
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:11,501
Done.

143
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:16,530
No, wait.

144
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:18,452
That's the guy that
saved my life.

145
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,924
Memory Recivery Institute
we do not do MRI's

146
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,993
Mr. Simpson, I have built
a device that will enable

147
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,111
you to explore your memories.

148
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:26,623
The science was easy,

149
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,180
but now I've got the hard part,

150
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:29,190
coming up with a name.

151
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:31,111
How about The Deja View-Master?

152
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:31,803
Uh...

153
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:33,591
Remembrance of things fast?
Hmm.

154
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:34,892
The Remembererer?

155
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,483
We don't have to come up with it now.

156
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:43,451
These wonderful wrinkle-bags
are reliving their

157
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,872
cherished memories of yesteryear.

158
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:48,361
Ah, my first Christmas.

159
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:50,601
Such great Chinese food.

160
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:51,672
This is great!

161
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:54,322
I'm finally gonna find
out how I ruined my family!

162
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,451
Strap me in, nerd!

163
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,552
To me, "nerd" stands for

164
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:00,263
Not Even Remotely Dorky,
so thank you.

165
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:01,430
Thank you for the compliment.

166
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:03,551
Now you'll feel a slight pinch,

167
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:06,093
followed by an extremely painful pinch,

168
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:08,763
signaling that the
spike will begin boring

169
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,861
into your skull three seconds later.

170
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:11,853
Boring.

171
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:12,703
Yes, that's right, boring.

172
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:13,020
Ow!

173
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:13,782
Ow!

174
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:14,422
Ow!

175
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:15,541
Three, two, one.

176
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:22,262
What the hell?

177
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:25,890
Your memory bubble and you

178
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:29,553
"This bubble allows you to view
any past event from your life."

179
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:33,410
Ah, it's got that new bubble smell.

180
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,010
Aw, I landed in a pleasant memory.

181
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:40,392
Look at happy me and playful them.

182
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:42,181
And we're off!

183
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:45,012
Now remember-steer into the sculptures.

184
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,190
Snow sculpture contest

185
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,823
Oh, I miss those by gone
days of earlier this week.

186
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,661
But I'm needed in a darker place.

187
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,903
Wha...?

188
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,233
Those squeaks sound like couch springs

189
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:29,491
grooving to the beat of love!

190
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:33,001
Hmm?

191
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:33,880
Homer!

192
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:36,420
I wasn't expecting you.

193
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:41,303
Hey, what's going on here?!

194
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:45,112
Oh, Homer, I didn't want
you to find out this way.

195
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:46,180
Another man...

196
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,010
with my wife...

197
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:47,900
in my house...

198
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,310
on top of my TV Guide?!

199
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:53,793
I got to find out who that guy is,

200
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:54,900
but I need help.

201
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:56,521
Someone like Bart,

202
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,101
only smart.

203
00:10:58,448 --> 00:10:59,351
Lisa!

204
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,031
Another me!

205
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,390
You can watch the kids.

206
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:12,471
Lisa, I'm about to probe the most
shattering moment of my life.

207
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:13,542
You want to join me?

208
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:14,421
Might as well.

209
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,273
You're getting this memory mixed
up with a commercial you saw.

210
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:18,972
With new Synergy Wireless,

211
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,791
night time minutes start at 6:30,

212
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,541
and you get four free d-cast
downloads per month.

213
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:25,743
Synergy--
it's your call.

214
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:29,393
<i>It's a beautiful morning</i>

215
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:37,072
<i>I think I'll go outside for a while...</i>

216
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:39,541
Yo, Homer, can you take me to when were

217
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:40,991
ten to see if I can kick your butt?

218
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:42,251
Bring it on.

219
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,413
You're superior to me in every way!

220
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,591
Well, let's see how you do
against 20-year-old Homer.

221
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:56,571
What is it you want from me?

222
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,481
Money? Weed? D'oh!

223
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:01,112
I'll teach you to beat up yester-me!

224
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:11,511
Dad, you just destroyed
your first kiss.

225
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:12,642
Who was it with?

226
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,350
Uh... Apu.

227
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:15,490
Right.

228
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,521
Kids, your mom is
with another man,

229
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,501
and I need you
to help me find out who he is.

230
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:30,333
Hmm. Is this really something
I should show you kids?

231
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:32,210
It's okay. We're not really your kids.

232
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:35,342
We're just representations of
them that you created in your mind.

233
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:38,120
Really? Then if I created all this,

234
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:40,963
that means I can have pizza
anytime I want!

235
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:44,851
Hello. I'd like to order a pizza.

236
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:46,791
35 minutes?!

237
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:52,190
Hey, what's going on here?!

238
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:53,903
See? That's where my memory stops.

239
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,071
Who the heck is that guy?

240
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:57,581
What if you just moved the bottle?

241
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,753
All right. Let me just
get out of this bubble

242
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,752
smoothly and elegantly.

243
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,801
How can I get my memory to work?

244
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:14,000
Declarative memory can be broken

245
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:14,931
into two subsets:

246
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,681
the episodic forms are stored

247
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:17,610
in the neocortex,

248
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,213
while the semantic ones are...

249
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:20,200
Oh, can that tuna!

250
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,050
We can get your brain
to work the same way

251
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:24,232
you always get the TV
to work --by hitting it.

252
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,350
Hey, what's going on here?

253
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,081
Oh, Homer, I didn't want you
to find out this way.

254
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,952
- Duffman!
- Duffman?

255
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:44,713
Duffman!

256
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,830
The mother of my children

257
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:48,963
with the reason for my children!

258
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:51,102
Stop, Homer! Please!

259
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,150
I'm just giving it to your wife.

260
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,481
She is gonna be sore tomorrow.

261
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:56,930
No!

262
00:13:58,117 --> 00:13:59,841
Your stupid invention made me

263
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:01,561
realize my life is worthless!

264
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:04,230
Well, if you can't stand
the neural activity,

265
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:06,072
stay out of the neural activator!

266
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:10,591
So I did have butter
nut squash last night.

267
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:14,460
My wife left me.

268
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:17,492
I've done horrible things.
My family's gone.

269
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,493
My life is ruined.

270
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,291
Good-bye, cruel world!

271
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:28,021
And good-bye, Cruller World.

272
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:29,671
Bye, Homer!

273
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:34,062
Suicide Bridge
in memory of governor Chester L. Suicide

274
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,003
Are you my guardian angel?

275
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:41,181
Yes, we are.

276
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:43,050
Jump and we'll carry you to Heaven.

277
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:46,601
Hey, aren't trolls supposed
to be under the bridge?

278
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:48,150
Ha, ha, good-bye.

279
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:50,701
Come on, what are you waiting for?

280
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,230
We want to see if the splash
reaches the moon.

281
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:55,682
- Good one.
- Wait a minute.

282
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:57,882
If killing myself
would make you two happy,

283
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:59,000
then I'm not gonna do it.

284
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,873
Don't worry about our happiness.

285
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:02,671
For once, think of yourself.

286
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:08,770
My life's flashing before my eyes.

287
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,343
A life well-lived.

288
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:14,792
Until last night.

289
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,540
I guess I'll have
to watch that now.

290
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,270
What's going on here?!

291
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:24,572
Oh, Homer,

292
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,943
I didn't want you
to find out this way.

293
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:29,943
We were planning
a surprise party for you.

294
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,150
A surprise party?!

295
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,651
This magic marker's
running out of ink.

296
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,181
I'm sorry your surprise party
was spoiled.

297
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,460
Are you kidding?

298
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:43,312
The mother of my children

299
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,310
with the reason for my children!

300
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:47,780
This is gonna be the
greatest party ever!

301
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,260
Oh, yeah!

302
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:51,263
Duff beer is sponsoring the party,

303
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:53,490
featuring new Duff Champagne

304
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:55,190
the beer of champagnes!

305
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:56,942
Oh, my God!

306
00:16:57,088 --> 00:16:59,963
It's like Christmas in December.
Let's celebrate now.

307
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:02,811
Stop, Homer! Please!

308
00:17:03,798 --> 00:17:04,891
My eye!

309
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:08,482
Don't worry, honey.
I'll get you an ice pack.

310
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:09,882
Where's the ice pack?

311
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,812
I'm just giving it to your wife.

312
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,213
She is gonna be sore tomorrow.

313
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:18,733
So Marge wasn't cheating on me;

314
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:20,910
I never hit her; and my family

315
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:23,091
is throwing me an awesome party.

316
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:26,282
Thank God I figured it out

317
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:28,292
before I did anything stupid.

318
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:31,363
Oh, right.

319
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:38,241
Oh, my God! I'm not dead!

320
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:43,091
Homie, this is your party!

321
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,092
This is great!

322
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:48,311
I must be the first
gullible husband

323
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:51,380
to overhear snippets
of surprise party planning

324
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:54,373
and think it was my wife
having an affair.

325
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,541
Keep it up, people.
The night is young!

326
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:06,623
Um, it's 11:00.

327
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,222
You want to pay for the extra hour?

328
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,200
Okay.

329
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:12,421
Par-tay, people!

330
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:15,402
Geez, Homer, I can't believe
your plan actually worked.

331
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:16,350
What plan?

332
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:18,142
Your plan to make the surprise party

333
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:19,372
a surprise again. Remember?

334
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:26,181
Marge put so much work
into that party.

335
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,491
The least I could do is be surprised.

336
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:31,192
If only I could forget
what happened today.

337
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,692
I got just the drink
to wipe your mind clean:

338
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:34,891
the "Forget-Me-Shot."

339
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:37,082
Fellas, if you got anything you
want to say to Homer

340
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:39,061
that he'll never remember, say it now.

341
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:40,812
Blue pants make you look fat.

342
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:42,131
I've never learned your kids' names.

343
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:43,290
Your yard is unkempt.

344
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:44,981
It is obvious you're bald.

345
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:46,313
Your thighs make noise.

346
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:48,260
I find your small hands attractive.

347
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,441
I've spit in every drink
I ever served you.

348
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,461
Bottoms up!

349
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,022
The only problem is,

350
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:57,282
I'm sure to retain some image
of coming home

351
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:59,032
and finding Duffman.

352
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,761
No doubt I'll misconstrue
that as him

353
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,282
placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow.

354
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,851
And that will make me
want to jump off a...

355
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:08,270
For the love of God,

356
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:10,352
make sure the party boat
has a moon bounce.

357
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:11,401
Okay.

358
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:17,052
I'm a genius.

359
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:19,622
But there are still a few things
I don't understand.

360
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:21,920
Like why did Marge lie to Chief Wiggum

361
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:23,723
about how she got that black eye?

362
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:26,721
Because I didn't want him
finding out about the party.

363
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:28,423
I mean, he's okay,

364
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,223
but you know he'd bring Sarah,

365
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:32,622
and I just don't care for that woman.

366
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:34,520
And when you pushed
me off the bridge,

367
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,433
it's 'cause you knew about the party

368
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,050
and wanted to make sure I got here.

369
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:39,650
Yeah, that must be it.

370
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:42,701
You know, there's an after-party
at the bottom of the ocean.

371
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:44,601
This is good for two free drinks.

372
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,970
The only thing that still
doesn't make sense is

373
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:50,221
why the dog attacked me.

374
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:51,650
Because you never feed him,

375
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,530
walk him or let him out to pee.

376
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,780
Who's an angry dog?

377
00:19:58,177 --> 00:19:59,481
Who's an angry dog?

378
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,922
Now who wants a beer?

379
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,501
To a man I'm happy to call

380
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:11,910
my best friend, Homer Simpsno!

381
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,070
Simpson!

382
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,943
Dyslexia, Duffman's secret shame.

383
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:22,313
Aren't you going to drink?

384
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:26,111
No, this is a moment
I want to remember.

385
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:33,711
<i>I remember finding out about you...</i>

386
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:43,010
<i>Every day my mind is all around you</i>

387
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:49,462
<i>Looking out from my lonely room</i>

388
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:54,070
<i>I give my love to you.</i>

389
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,913
