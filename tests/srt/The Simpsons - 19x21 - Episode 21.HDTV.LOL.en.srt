<font color="#ffff00">Sync by NightWalker</font>

4
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,050
(laughs)

5
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:02,484
You've fallen right
into my trap,

6
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,017
just like you
did in Africa.

7
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,284
Krusty, there you are.

8
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:07,484
We've got business
to discuss.

9
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:08,551
First off,

10
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:09,850
we got big problems

11
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,750
with your talking
home pregnancy tests.

12
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,683
Hey-hey, you're pregnant
and it's not mine!

13
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,417
(laughing)

14
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:20,084
It's giving 20%
false "hey-heys."

15
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:23,584
Oh, okay, uh,
repackage them

16
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,984
as coffee stirrers and sell
them in the Philippines.

17
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,151
Genius.
Now, another issue:

18
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:30,017
Studies show
your Krusty Burger

19
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,417
is the unhealthiest fast-food
item in the world.

20
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,351
Worse than
the Double Krusty Burger?

21
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,618
Somehow, yes.

22
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,783
Okay, here's what we do.

23
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,451
What's that food we never
put in any of our meals?

24
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:44,151
Vegetables?
Yeah, those guys.

25
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:45,917
Find the cheapest one,

26
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:47,417
and make a burger
out of it.

27
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,717
Then throw it in a green
wrapper and double the price.

28
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:51,551
And say it's got
none of those, uh,

29
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,117
what are those unhealthy
he-she sounding things?

30
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:55,551
Uh, trans fats?

31
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,650
That's it!
And while you're in there,

32
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:00,017
spray a little nicotine juice
on the kids' meals.

33
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:01,351
Get 'em hooked.
(laughs)

34
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,750
ANNOUNCER:
Coming up on:

35
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:09,984
(crewman shouting)

36
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,618
(grunting)

37
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:14,817
It was worth it
to be on TV!

38
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:16,717
Put our dying screams
in the promo!

39
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:18,384
(both screaming)

40
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:21,750
You know, kids,

41
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:25,717
the real drowningest
catch is man.

42
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:38,017
It's a new world out there.

43
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,817
People care about their health,
for some reason.

44
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,750
<i>We know times have changed.</i>

45
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:46,584
<i>And we at Krusty Burger want
to take advantage of that.</i>

46
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,351
<i>Introducing...
the Mother Nature Burger.</i>

47
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,917
<i>Made from 100%
wheat-fed barley.</i>

48
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:54,117
And now to take a yummy bite.

49
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:01,017
Mmm... tastes like
a healthy future.

50
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,884
We're going
to Krusty Burger!

51
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,518
Finally, a hamburger
for the Hindus.

52
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,117
By the tusks of great Ganesh,

53
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:22,284
now no one can tell
I am not American.

54
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:24,217
(sitar music plays, Apu chants)

55
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,151
Look at me!
I'm saving the Earth!

56
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,518
Where's my Nobel prize?

57
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:36,384
(bubbly rumbling)

58
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:40,783
What's wrong, old friend?
Can't sleep?

59
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,584
(rumbling continues)
Aww.

60
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,850
Would some warm beer
settle you down?

61
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,384
(rumbling continues)
Uh-oh.

62
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,484
Those barley burgers
were tainted!

63
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:54,351
Why did I eat 12 of them? Why?!

64
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:56,884
Taken!

65
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,750
Occupied!

66
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:02,884
Hurling!

67
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:13,050
(muffled):
Uh-oh.

68
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:14,518
(teachers and kids groaning)

69
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:16,117
SKINNER (over P.A.):
Attention, students,

70
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:18,017
due to the recent
queasiness,

71
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,184
both the Presidential
Ab-Crunch Challenge

72
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,650
and the Sloppy Joe-A-Thon
have been cancelled.

73
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:23,717
(weakly):
Skinner!

74
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,117
If I die,

75
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:27,451
I want you to take over...
Really?

76
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:30,351
...the search committee
for a new superintendent.

77
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,850
Mm...

78
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,783
Just hold my head and
say soothing things.

79
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,950
Third-grade math scores
are holding steady.

80
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:40,284
Ah, yes...

81
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:41,984
The food poisoning
has been traced

82
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,584
to a single ingredient:
tainted barley.

83
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,484
And where does that
barley come from?

84
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:49,384
Our neighbor to the southeast,
Ogdenville.

85
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,384
The state's barley basket
since it was settled

86
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,451
100 years ago,
by Norwegian immigrants.

87
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:56,484
I'm here with barley farmer
Brendlf Jensen. Brendlf?

88
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:59,117
What happened is,
a big ol' rat got caught up

89
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:02,950
in the grinders there, so my
wife, Dagny, took a hose to it.

90
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:04,984
And, uh, it's all
cleaned out now.

91
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,984
So you're
guaranteeing it's safe

92
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,050
to eat Ogdenville barley
once more?

93
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:12,184
Well, where there's barley,
there's rats, you know.

94
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,518
Now, when will you
be starting the interview?

95
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,050
That just went out live.

96
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:18,917
Well, then we're screwed.

97
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,783
(slow, melancholy
orchestral theme playing)

98
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,001
Dad, are you
sure you can

99
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,234
put in these new rain
gutters all by yourself?

100
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,533
Eh, maybe you're right.

101
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,734
I do have a bad history
of going up on roofs

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
and waking up in hospitals.

103
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,533
Perhaps we could be
of help, don't you know.

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,268
Ogdenvillians?
Work on my house?

105
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,334
<i>Ja. Ever since
the barley bust,</i>

106
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,368
the only work we can get
is day labor.

107
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:24,368
We don't mind it.
Work is work.

108
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,834
I like your
can-do attitude!

109
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:30,400
And your facial hair screams
rugged but reliable.

110
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,767
You won't regret
this, sir.

111
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:32,901
You hear that, Bart?

112
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,368
He called me "sir."

113
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,867
That means he knows
I'm better than him.

114
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:41,600
Nicely done, guys.
Lemonade?

115
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,634
A lemon version
of barley-ade?

116
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,467
(chuckles):
When in Springfield...

117
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,301
Oh, don't that glug
down right good then.

118
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,268
<i>Oh, ja, almost
as good as barley-ade.</i>

119
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,867
<i>Mm-hmm.
Oh, ja. Oh, ja.</i>

120
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,500
You know, I'm glad
you've come here

121
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,334
to take all the jobs
we don't want to do.

122
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,134
Can't have too much
of a good thing.

123
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:03,834
OGDENVILLIAN:
You fellas, too, come on!

124
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,301
<i>( music playing throughout )</i>

125
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:13,001
<i>( women vocalizing )</i>

126
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:36,550
So, Inga, this
is our kitchen.

127
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:39,250
Did you have kitchens
back in Ogdenville?

128
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:42,051
<i>Ja, before the dark days
fell on my people</i>

129
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:43,651
and we lost everything.

130
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:46,817
Great! So you know your
way around a blender.

131
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:48,984
Okay, so if the dog's
in the house,

132
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,550
don't let Grampa
in and vice versa.

133
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:54,984
Our neighbor, Ned Flanders,
drops by unexpectedly.

134
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,984
That I do!
But he doesn't stay long.

135
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:58,250
No, I don't!

136
00:08:58,317 --> 00:09:01,051
Kids, this is Inga,
your new nanny.

137
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:02,951
A nanny? Whoo-hoo!

138
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:04,684
Mom says I can have ice cream
for breakfast.

139
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:05,884
Oh, she's still here.

140
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,150
Mom, can I have
ice cream for breakfast?

141
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:08,717
No way, mister.

142
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:11,584
It's just chocolate chip
pancakes and syrup for you.

143
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,051
Inga, I'll be happy
to eat whatever you make.

144
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:16,150
(frustrated grunt)

145
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:18,817
Maggie, now you have a nanny.

146
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,684
Just like the ones
Joe Piscopo

147
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:22,951
and Ethan Hawke
left their wives for.

148
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:24,917
But hands off my Homie.

149
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:28,350
Hands off the Homie.
Got it.

150
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,484
(whimpers)

151
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,350
Sorry, sometimes
she's nervous

152
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,584
around new people.

153
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:34,617
Actually,
she's just gassy.

154
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:37,350
A little lingonberry oil
under the tongue will clear it

155
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,584
right up.
(Maggie coos, burbles)

156
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:41,817
That's amazing!

157
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:45,018
Now I feel bad about
calling your references.

158
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:49,350
So Selma,
how did you meet?

159
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,283
I hired Torbjorn, here,

160
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,917
to kill some moles
in my garden.

161
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:56,018
And, well, one thing
led to another...

162
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:58,183
<i>Ja, she has the same
beautiful face</i>

163
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,984
as my great-uncle Magnus
when he lay in the coffin

164
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,717
after his trolley
accident.

165
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,717
Gee, this
Ogdenville influx

166
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:06,617
has been great
for everybody.

167
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:11,217
Yeah, talk about taking jobs
Springfield don't want!

168
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,150
(laughs)
Hey, Homer, your blubber

169
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,350
would light our
lamps for a year.
D'oh!

170
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,617
I zing the oaf good?

171
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,550
You zing the oaf great.

172
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:26,384
Minnesota Vikings apparel?!

173
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,717
This is Tennessee
Titans country!

174
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:31,617
Waah!

175
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,717
Uff da!
So many meters.

176
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,150
(kids agreeing)

177
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,884
Step aside, Nor-wads.

178
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,751
Watch how the natives ride sky.

179
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:44,851
(The Chantays'
"Pipeline" begins)

180
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,217
(yells)

181
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:02,884
(groans)

182
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:09,717
Three hours and we still
can't see a doctor?!

183
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:12,684
It's 'cause it's filled
with all these Nor-wads.

184
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:14,384
They even sneeze funny.

185
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,150
(sneezing):
A-fer-gan-nerkin!
A-fer-gan-nerkin!

186
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:20,651
We're out of English forms.

187
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,617
You'll have to fill out
a Norwegian one.

188
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:26,450
I can't read this
sloopy-bloopy writing.

189
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:29,283
Typical-- foreigners
clogging up the system.

190
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,951
I hurt my back unclogging
your septic system.

191
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:33,684
Sven, can you stop
by tomorrow?

192
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,051
<i>It's clogged again.
Ja.</i>

193
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:36,484
Come on, Bart.

194
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,283
We'll take care
of you at home.

195
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,018
(sneezing):
Na-chin-na-hart!
Na-chin-na-hart!

196
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:44,250
Oh great, I
caught their cold.

197
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:46,951
Okay, Bart.

198
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:50,084
Now bite down on the
rubber dog bone, and...

199
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,717
(toy squeaks,
bone snaps)

200
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:52,817
Mm!

201
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:54,384
(barks)

202
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,951
Thanks, Mom.

203
00:11:56,018 --> 00:11:58,417
Now, how did this
happen again?

204
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,884
It wasn't my fault.
I swear.

205
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:02,217
A couple of barleyjerks
dared me to.

206
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:04,751
Yeah, well, I'm starting
to wonder if this town

207
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:07,450
wasn't better off before all
these immigrants showed up.

208
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:09,051
I'd just like to remind you

209
00:12:09,118 --> 00:12:10,884
that we were all immigrants
at one time.

210
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,484
Well, you were a baby once.

211
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,417
Does that mean you still
like milk and hugs?

212
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,217
Yes, I'd like both right now.

213
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,051
(grunts)

214
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,517
Hey, this is all right.

215
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,350
(humming tune)

216
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,984
Look at them barleyjacks,

217
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:31,851
celebrating another one
of their stupid holidays.

218
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,817
Hey, I ain't got no
problem with them.

219
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,751
They pay in cash,
they keep it clean,

220
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:38,051
and their mythology is
rich and enchanting.

221
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:41,118
Yeah, and the redhead one
said today's the day
Woden gave the herring

222
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:43,951
the greatest gift of all--
its fishy taste.

223
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:46,350
Hey, Moe, what is that
hoity-toity beer
they're drinking?

224
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,884
Oh, I don't sell
beer no more.

225
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:49,584
I only serve Aquavit,

226
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:51,851
the Norwegian caraway-scented
liqueur.

227
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,350
Wait a minute-- you're
selling barleyjack booze?

228
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:55,784
How could you, Moe?!

229
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,917
Hey, it's all about
the King Haralds.

230
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,283
Well, since it's all you've got,

231
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,183
give me a mug of that
Aquavit stuff.

232
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,183
Better go slow
there, friend.

233
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,084
That stuff will open up a can
of "oh my goodness" on you.

234
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,851
I think I can handle it.

235
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:19,751
(drunkenly):
Hey, where'd that Homer guy go?

236
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,717
(muffled):
More Aquavit, please.

237
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:27,283
(groans)

238
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,283
(drunkenly):
Farfegnugen...

239
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,717
You're late.
And drunk.

240
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:31,751
Shut up.

241
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:33,851
You lost your job?

242
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,283
It's not my fault.

243
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,684
Those Ogdenville guys plied me

244
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,617
with their native liqueurs
and liquors.

245
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,484
But mostly liqueurs.

246
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,484
Oh, poor Homie.

247
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,984
And you with
your alcoholism.

248
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:46,817
Yeah.

249
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,951
I propose that no
Ogdenvillian be allowed

250
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,784
within the city limits
of Springfield.

251
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:56,051
I share your xylophobia.

252
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,751
Dad, you mean
xenophobia.

253
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,217
Xylophobia would be
a fear of xylophones.

254
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:02,217
I am afraid of xylophones.

255
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,951
It's the music you hear
when skeletons are dancing.

256
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,350
Very well.

257
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:09,517
Springfield will ban
immigrants and xylophones.

258
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,317
All in favor, say "Aye."

259
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,217
ALL:
Aye!

260
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:14,851
The border is now closed.

261
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:18,217
You'll never take my xylophone.

262
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:20,851
Notes don't fail me now.

263
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,417
(playing rapidly)

264
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:26,851
There's one, Chief.

265
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,350
Well, he's too far, Lou.

266
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,450
That's not fair.

267
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:30,550
There's another.

268
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:31,984
He's on a bike, Lou.

269
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:33,183
So?

270
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,651
So what am I, Superman?

271
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,584
Well, there's one coming
between your legs.

272
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:38,084
Where?
There! Now!

273
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,717
Right now, look
between your legs!

274
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,384
I don't-- Oh, oh yeah.

275
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,784
Oh, ow, ow...
No, he's too fast.

276
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:44,951
It's hopeless, Lou.

277
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,817
We can't handle this.

278
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:48,484
We need help
patrolling the border.

279
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,450
I mean, Springfield
only has three cops.

280
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:52,517
Yeah. And Eddie's laid up
'cause of his gout.

281
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:55,550
(groans)

282
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:58,984
Yep. Eddie loves his
lobster and port wine,

283
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:00,450
but it comes with a price.

284
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:04,118
Excuse me: do you have to pay
to get in, or...?

285
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,450
No, no, no, it's
free, it's free.

286
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,984
Maybe we can ask private
citizens to guard the border.

287
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:11,283
Yeah, you know, vigilantes
who would agree to do our job

288
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,717
for the adrenaline rush

289
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,917
that comes from having
a tiny taste of authority

290
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:16,183
over your fellow man.

291
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,651
And all we're paying 'em
is bullets and beer.

292
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,851
(chuckles)

293
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:35,084
I almost made a big mistake.

294
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:46,451
Men, our negative energy
has been harnessed

295
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:49,117
to help keep Springfield's
borders secure

296
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,417
from Ogdenvillians.

297
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:52,551
But first, our group
needs a name

298
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,017
that evokes America's proud
history of citizens rising up

299
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,551
to defend our way of life.

300
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:57,984
The Klan?

301
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,884
Well, there are no bad ideas,
but let's keep trying.

302
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,884
The Nazis?

303
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,783
Okay, you stop trying.

304
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,151
Hey, how about the Star-Spangled
Goofballs?

305
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,151
Mm! Goofballs it is!

306
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,817
I'll float above the border,

307
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:11,950
and radio the location
of illegals down to you.

308
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:14,084
My code name will be
"Screaming Eagle."

309
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,184
Yours will be "Ground Losers."

310
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,184
What a fun day.
This is gonna
be good.

311
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:20,084
Release the sandbags.

312
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,650
Hey, why don't you
let Carl and me try?

313
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,783
Okay, you guys get
in as I get off.

314
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,417
(yelling)

315
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:31,518
This is Ground Loser.

316
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:32,750
What's your position?

317
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:33,850
Over.

318
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,251
C-c-cold.

319
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:37,551
S-s-so very cold.

320
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,217
I'm sorry to say that this
poorly-conceived patrol

321
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:46,317
carried out by a group
of rank amateurs

322
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:47,783
has somehow been a failure.

323
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,317
Those barleyjacks are crafty.

324
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,451
One of 'em handcuffed me
to this tree.

325
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:53,750
That's not a
tree, Chief.

326
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,084
That's a street sign.

327
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:56,584
You just looped
your belt around it

328
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,950
when you were
changing your pants.

329
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,783
Okay, I'm hearing lots of
problems, but no solutions.

330
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,850
This immigration problem is
bigger than we thought.

331
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,717
We need a way to keep these
people out of our community.

332
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:09,518
What can we do to keep
one group of people

333
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:11,284
away from another
group of people?

334
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,917
HOMER:
Why you little...!

335
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:16,984
I'll kill you!

336
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:22,151
That's it--
we'll build a fence.

337
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:24,683
CROWD (chanting):
Fence! Fence! Fence! Fence!

338
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,850
Homie, I don't think we
should build a fence.

339
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,384
Haven't we always taught
the children to make friends

340
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,384
with those who are
a little different?

341
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,518
Yes.
Yeah.

342
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,817
<i>Ja!
(gasps)</i>

343
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,117
<i>Ja, ja!</i>

344
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:41,650
Maggie's first words
are in Ogdenvillese!

345
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:43,284
Now do you see, Marge?

346
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,551
Now do you see why we
must build that fence?

347
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,317
Build it, Homie!

348
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:49,984
Make it as tall as the sky
and deeper than Hell.

349
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,985
Ja. Ja.

350
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,267
All right, who here knows
how to build a wall?

351
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,534
I know how to hire guys
to build a wall.

352
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,434
Such as?

353
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:00,534
The Barleyjacks?

354
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,134
(all agreeing)

355
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,534
Okay, they can help,
us build the wall,

356
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:06,167
because they're good at it.

357
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,067
But then, those
good-for-nothings have to go.

358
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:09,267
(cheering)

359
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:10,734
Yeah, get 'em
out of here!

360
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,501
(Benny Goodman's
"Sing, Sing, Sing" playing)

361
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,833
So my girlfriend puts all
these pillows on the bed.

362
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,267
And you have to like take
them all off at night

363
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:28,634
and put them all back
on every morning.

364
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:30,967
And if the little one is
in back of the big one,

365
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,734
oh, God help you.

366
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,267
<i>Ja, and they always want the
cat to sleep in bed with you.</i>

367
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:37,967
Exactly.

368
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,567
I had trouble finding a
four-button cardigan,

369
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:43,933
so I bought
a three-button one

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,634
and sewed the extra
button on myself.

371
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:47,234
Hm! This baby was
a five-buttoner,

372
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,601
but I took a button off.

373
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,567
Maybe we're not so
different, Sven.

374
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:52,701
<i>Ja, maybe so.</i>

375
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,701
You know, if you put
down an acrylic primer,

376
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:02,367
your satiric drawing
and its clever stink
lines will be there

377
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,000
long after your
principal is gone.

378
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,200
The guy at the store
said it didn't matter,

379
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:07,701
but I knew he was wrong.

380
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:08,567
Thanks, man.

381
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:13,067
(all shouting)

382
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:19,867
(clang echoing)

383
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:28,567
(wind whistling)

384
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,601
(Ralph giggling)

385
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,668
Sure is quiet around here.

386
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,967
Do ya miss us?

387
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:39,200
<i>Ja, we miss you.</i>

388
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:40,634
That's why we build
the door.

389
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,800
Oh, we did miss you.

390
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:45,567
We missed your kindness,
your hard work,

391
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,234
your sweet plainspoken ways.

392
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:49,467
What are you barleyjacks
waiting for?

393
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:51,067
Get in here!

394
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:53,768
We'd be more than pleased
to join you donut-dunkers.

395
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,067
(lively chatter
and laughter)

396
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:01,601
(siren wailing)

397
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:07,867
All right, boys,
round 'em up...

398
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:11,034
and throw them the swingingest
soiree they've ever seen!

399
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:18,167
(lively Scandanavian
folk music playing)

9999
