1
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:08,344
The Simpsons S19E11
- That '90s Show -

2
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:37,842
Dad, I'm freezing.

3
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:39,149
Don't worry, kids.

4
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,934
These wool socks and down
parkas will keep you warm.

5
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,407
We wouldn't be in
this trouble if you'd just

6
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:49,737
paid the heating bill !

7
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:52,198
I thought global warming
would take care of it.

8
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,342
Al Gore can't do
anything right.

9
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,082
I got some old
magazines to burn.

10
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:57,720
Popular Science.

11
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,882
Redbook.

12
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,161
Big & Tall Halloween
Costume catalogue.

13
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,259
Next item.

14
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:06,252
No ! ! ! ! !

15
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,662
Mom, I didn't know
you went to college !

16
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:16,443
Yeah, you always said
that after high school,

17
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,673
Dad "blessed" you with
the unplanned miracle of me.

18
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:23,312
Hey, parents are allowed
to keep some secrets.

19
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:25,211
Like which kid's
their favorite !

20
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,281
It's Lisa.

21
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:32,540
You know, Mom and Dad
are almost 40, and Bart is ten.

22
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:36,373
That means you didn't have him
until way after high school.

23
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:39,050
Yeah, what happened while
I was chillin' in Dad's junk ?

24
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,060
There is a part of our past that

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,222
we haven't told you kids about.

26
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:45,041
A turbulent part.

27
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,413
Come on.
More turbulent than now ?

28
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:49,481
We're in every kind of therapy.

29
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,342
Things happened between your mother
and me that we're not proud of.

30
00:01:52,342 --> 00:01:55,960
It was the middle of a wild decade
known as the 1990s.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,743
The '90s ? Never heard of it.

32
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,972
Oh, it was a wonderful time.

33
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:02,401
The Iraq war was over
once and for all,

34
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,362
a struggling Matt Groening
created Futurama,

35
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,900
and young people
believed in their dreams,

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,703
thanks to a TV show
called Melrose Place.

37
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:13,962
<i>Your mother and I were dating,</i>

38
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,333
<i>and we had just moved into</i>

39
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,942
<i>our first apartment together.</i>

40
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:23,281
Luann, a picture of
you cheating on me

41
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,021
is downloading
onto my computer.

42
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,871
I'll know who you were with
in less than six hours !

43
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,731
Unless someone
picks up the phone.

44
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:31,281
No, no, no, no ! Oh !

45
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,463
<i>We didn't have a lot of money,</i>

46
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:35,273
<i>but we were young and in love.</i>

47
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:37,991
Oh !

48
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,142
I'm afraid it's
Top Ramen again.

49
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:41,082
With you, baby,

50
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:43,660
Top Ramen tastes
like Cup O' Noodles.

51
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:51,251
You know, these IKEA foam
futons do Velcro together.

52
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,312
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

53
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,153
I'm not ready
to do that yet.

54
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:56,903
I want to wait
until I'm married,

55
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:58,211
or at least really drunk.

56
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,211
I understand.

57
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:02,120
We should follow the lead
of today's celebrity role models.

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,790
Sonic The hedghog says
"Wait until marriage".

59
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,252
<i>Like all young people,</i>

60
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,463
<i>I had a musical dream,</i>

61
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:08,593
<i>a dream called inoffensive urban light</i>

62
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:10,280
<i>hip-hop smooth grooves.</i>

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,723
Okay, everyone,
let's warm up our harmonies.

64
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:14,222
<i>Homer</i>

65
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:15,373
<i>Lenny</i>

66
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:16,331
<i>Carl</i>

67
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,891
<i>Lou the Cop</i>

68
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:24,811
<i>I'll make rub to you
Show respect for you</i>

69
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:30,183
<i>Hug so safe and strong
Backrub all night long !</i>

70
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:32,593
<i>I'll make rub to you !</i>

71
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:35,471
<i>But our happiness
was about to unravel</i>

72
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:37,980
<i>just like Kevin Costner's career:</i>

73
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,103
<i>because of the postman.</i>

74
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,032
You applied to college ?

75
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,313
Why didn't you tell me ?

76
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:44,550
I did tell you.

77
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,421
I thought you were
telling me you wanted

78
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:48,990
to apply yourself to
making a collage.

79
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,613
And as I recall,
I was against it.

80
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,521
I can't believe I got in.

81
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:54,500
It's like a dream come true.

82
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,231
An expensive dream.

83
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,001
Oh, baby, you deserve
every last bit of it !

84
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,162
I can get the money,

85
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,842
but it'll mean swallowing
my pride and working for...

86
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:09,443
my dad !

87
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,172
Well, Well, Well,

88
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:15,801
look who's come crawling back
to work for your old man.

89
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,522
What do you need
the money for ?

90
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,122
Medicine ?

91
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,221
None of your business.

92
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:22,062
Now give me a job
at your business.

93
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:22,893
You're dead !

94
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:24,311
Die ! Die ! Die !

95
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:25,302
Suck my beam !

96
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:29,190
Okay, all right !
Time's up !

97
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:36,910
This counts as your break.

98
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,000
<i>But Marge's education was worth</i>

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,952
<i>all the pistol-whipping in the world.</i>

100
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:44,561
This place is just
like the brochure:

101
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,323
Autumn leaves.

102
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:47,952
Bull sessions.

103
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:49,271
And that is why

104
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,761
The Lord of the Rings
can never be filmed.

105
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:54,701
Fraternity pledges
in their beanies.

106
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:57,823
I think I'm gonna like it here.

107
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:04,240
So, have you all bought the required
textbooks for this class ?

108
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:05,721
Good.

109
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,760
Now throw them all away !

110
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,530
Everything you think you
know about history is a lie.

111
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,261
For example:
the Founding Fathers.

112
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:18,521
What did they have in common ?

113
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:19,512
They defied a king ?

114
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:21,911
They created a system
of checks and balances ?

115
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:22,752
Wrong !

116
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:26,522
They were all white, Protestant,
property-owning males.

117
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,240
Evil

118
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:37,901
Are you saying that America was
founded on misconceptions ?

119
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,122
Who said that ?

120
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:47,983
That is exactly
what I'm saying.

121
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:52,620
<i>Fall semester,
you just got interesting.</i>

122
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,832
The bridges of
Madison county.

123
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:58,773
This book sucks so much.

124
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:01,951
Homie, my mind has been
opened in so many ways !

125
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:04,121
Did you know that
every US president

126
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:06,270
has been a straight white man ?

127
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,890
Even Walt Disney ?

128
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,113
And did you also know that history
is written by the winners ?

129
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:11,613
Really ?

130
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:13,481
I thought it was
written by losers.

131
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:17,700
If you think that,

132
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,253
you should meet my
new professor.

133
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,183
Professor August has shown me
a side of the world I never knew.

134
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,651
Professor August, eh ?

135
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,992
Who is he, somegray-haired
old bookworm ?

136
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:29,042
Uh, not exactly.

137
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:29,842
Marge,

138
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:32,683
I hope I'll be seeing you
tomorrow during office hours.

139
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:36,561
Uh, 3:00 to 5:00, right ?

140
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,773
If my beads are parted,
come right in.

141
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,452
I will !

142
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,823
To the faculty club !

143
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:50,690
I never heard that noise before.

144
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,762
Are you sick ?

145
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:56,271
Hmm. I wonder what's on your mind.

146
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,589
Okay, I relate your pilot light.

147
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,071
Now I just need to do a
little work on the thermostat.

148
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:08,370
Would you like me to
tell you a story while I work ?

149
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,621
One about a woman
I loved and lost ?

150
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:12,750
We're in the middle of
our own story, thank you.

151
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,562
Right. No one wants to hear
about the gasman's girl.

152
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:18,500
"Just shut up, monkey man,
and make the gas flow. "

153
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,061
Anyway,
I was growing to admire

154
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:23,591
my professor more and more.

155
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:26,072
...so that's why
instead of "X-X",

156
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:29,233
I think of the female genes
in a more positive light...

157
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:32,153
Plus-Plus.

158
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:37,070
Professor, do you think
white male scientists

159
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,873
have marginalized the
contributions of the Third World ?

160
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:41,690
Great question.

161
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,661
And the answer is "of course. "

162
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:46,073
Could a tribe of bushmen
have invented penicillin ?

163
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:47,380
Maybe they already have.

164
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,712
But no one asked them.

165
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,822
No one asked them.

166
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:01,590
Oh, Elaine, will you ever find
someone who's sponge-worthy ?

167
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,512
Professor August says the situation
comedy is a doomed genre.

168
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:06,880
Here's what I say to that:

169
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,732
no soup for you !

170
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,580
Because I am "master of my domain".

171
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,243
Newman.

172
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,670
I wish you would support my comments.

173
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,333
Hey, I worked hard all day
to pay for your education.

174
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,021
Can't I get all Zima'd up and have

175
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,431
my best girl put salve
on my laser burns ?

176
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:24,430
Are the lasers supposed to burn you ?

177
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,110
Apparently if all the kids fire

178
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,511
at your stomach at once, it adds up.

179
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:49,182
<i>Closing time open all the doors</i>

180
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:53,811
<i>and let you out into the world...</i>

181
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:59,640
Marge, your art project for
"protest studies" is very impressive.

182
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:04,521
Thank you, Professor August.

183
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:06,293
Oh, please, I'm your advisor.

184
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:07,463
Call me Steffan.

185
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:11,271
Oh, thanks.

186
00:09:11,271 --> 00:09:13,521
It-it's just a note
from my boyfriend.

187
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:14,380
Let me guess:

188
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,732
he's a high school flame

189
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:17,223
who's preventing you
from flowering.

190
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,800
Homer's perfect for me !

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,111
Just look at this note:

192
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:22,023
"I miss you. "Aww.

193
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:24,941
Actually, Marge, if I may
deconstruct that letter.

194
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,741
When he writes "I miss you,"

195
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:29,613
"I" is the subject
and "you" is the object.

196
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:31,733
You are his object.

197
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,490
But Homer's so supportive.

198
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,723
He's paying for me
to go to college.

199
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:37,143
He's paying for you ?

200
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,443
Like he owns you ?

201
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,403
I'm sorry, but that is oppression.

202
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:43,442
Well, I know you'd never say
anything that isn't objective...

203
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,243
Marge, your assignment is
to think about

204
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,342
what I've said about
your relationship.

205
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:48,571
When is it due ?

206
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,891
Before it's too late.

207
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,491
Steffan !

208
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:54,250
Marge ! Marge !

209
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,313
Where are you ? !

210
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:59,892
Are you by that
Joan Miro Statue ?

211
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,763
lt's "Juan" Miro !

212
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:03,410
Stupid townie !

213
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:07,212
Hey, it's townies like me
that cook your food and

214
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:08,140
clean your bathrooms !

215
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,953
If you did the former better
we'd use the latter less.

216
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:14,553
That's it, townie !

217
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:15,222
Run !

218
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:17,171
Run back to your town !

219
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:20,310
Marge, this dreamcatcher
was given to me by a warrior

220
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,420
of the Lakopane tribe,
a tribe ruled by women.

221
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,421
I think it has already
caught my dream.

222
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:31,721
What the hell is
going on here ?

223
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:32,581
Chanting ? !

224
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:34,510
Homer !
You're embarrassing me !

225
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,983
Marge, what are you doing
in this crazy college ?

226
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:39,313
This place is nothing
like Animal House !

227
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:42,952
I smashed a beatnik's guitar
and he sued me for damages !

228
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,882
Successfully !

229
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:46,390
Homie, go home.

230
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,963
We'll talk about this later.

231
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:48,693
Fine !

232
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:52,293
Slam !

233
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,243
I can't do it !

234
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,920
Our harmony-laden R&B doesn't

235
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,653
make sense in this cruel world.

236
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,580
I'm taking our music to
the next level :

237
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,893
Guitar Rock Utilizing
Nihilist Grunge Energies.

238
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:12,533
Or, as I call it: Grunge !

239
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,832
We are Sadgasm,

240
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,530
and this song is called...

241
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,603
"Politically Incorrect. "

242
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:30,370
Pain is brown

243
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:34,270
Hate is white

244
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:38,322
Love is black

245
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,432
Stab the night

246
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:47,110
Kingdom of numb

247
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:51,080
Closet of hurt

248
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:55,550
Feelings are dumb

249
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,602
Kisses are dirt...

250
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:00,600
Kurt ? Kurt ?

251
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,520
It's Marvin !

252
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,780
Your cousin, Marvin Cobain !

253
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,640
You know that new sound
you're looking for ?

254
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,950
Well, listen to this !

255
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:12,750
Marge ! Marge !

256
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:17,191
Hey, Marge.

257
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:20,152
Homer, your music is
so angry and bitter.

258
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:21,730
Now why would I be angry and bitter ?

259
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,710
Because I'm paying for
you to make goo-goo eyes

260
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,683
at some smooth-talking professor ?

261
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,070
Well, here's a question for you:

262
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,361
why should I stay with a man
who resents how I've flowered ?

263
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,273
Well, if you feel that
way maybe you can find

264
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:34,533
someone who wants to
nurture the new you,

265
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:37,272
maybe someone a little
older and more sophisticated,

266
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:40,420
who can take you to
Europe during the summer.

267
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,283
- Fine by me.
- D'oh !

268
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:48,810
Hey. Will you sign my boobs ?

269
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,693
Yeah.

270
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:51,693
Marge come back.

271
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,921
Mom, why did you stop talking
for two and a half minutes ?

272
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:00,462
It seemed like 20.

273
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:01,211
Whatever.

274
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,380
Homer and I had the wrenching task

275
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,720
of dividing up a shared life.

276
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,661
Okay, I'll keep the LPs,
and you take the CDs.

277
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:11,943
I'll take the typewriter;
you take the computer.

278
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:15,021
I'll take the Enron stock;
you take the Microsoft stock.

279
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:15,901
And, um...

280
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,211
Who gets... Cutie-puss ?

281
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,903
I just want a tentacle.

282
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,000
<i>I was so depressed,</i>

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,751
<i>I spent all my time in a bar.</i>

284
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,000
Gimme a beer, Moe.

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,472
I don't sell booze no more.

286
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,242
This is a cigar bar now.

287
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:46,473
Fine. Cohiba me.

288
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:49,302
Leave the humidor.

289
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,443
I don't feel so good.

290
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,573
I wasn't trying to steal your watch.

291
00:14:03,573 --> 00:14:05,511
I-I was just comin' on to ya.

292
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,570
Okay, let's go back
to my place.

293
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,703
Oh, boy.

294
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:13,042
Ready to take my personal
tour of Springfield's

295
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,811
most wheelchair-unfriendly
restaurants ?

296
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,263
I sure am !

297
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:19,603
I want your knowledge inside me.

298
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:28,320
Seeing Marge always
reminds me of Marge.

299
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:34,741
Now where will I get my oxygen ?

300
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:45,132
Razorblade of apathy

301
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:48,820
Shave me with your irony

302
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:51,810
Shave me !

303
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:54,061
Shave me !

304
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,682
Have you really read
all of these books ?

305
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:03,522
Morally, I couldn't display
them on shelves if I hadn't.

306
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,901
But I watch sports as well,

307
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:06,733
just like a regular man.

308
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,073
Good Goddess !

309
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:12,392
The Patriots deep
in Redskin territory.

310
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:13,850
This isn't entertainment;

311
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,371
it's genocide !

312
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,380
Why don't we put on some music ?

313
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,890
Shave me !

314
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:24,512
No ! No !

315
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,073
I need whale songs !

316
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:27,083
Oceans of the sea

317
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:36,042
Marge, may I compliment
your appearance ?

318
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,070
Yeah, sure.

319
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,690
You look lovely.

320
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,663
If I were to approach you for a kiss,

321
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:42,922
would you construe
that as harassment

322
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,381
or give your willing consent ?

323
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,360
Consent, of course.

324
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,771
Ah. Continuing in that line of thought,

325
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,722
may I kiss your mouth with my mouth ?

326
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:53,553
Just do it already !

327
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:59,202
<i>I had finally realized
every rock star's dream:</i>

328
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:01,032
<i>hating being famous.</i>

329
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,451
Why aren't I happy ?

330
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:11,503
I'm the hottest grunge
artist on Mucous Records.

331
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,841
Weird Al is doing
a parody of my song.

332
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:17,492
Raisin bread with applesauce

333
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:21,493
Tony Danza, he's the boss

334
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:24,252
Brain freeze !

335
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:26,491
Brain freeze !

336
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,702
Brain freeze !

337
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:30,750
Brain freeze !

338
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:35,601
He who is tired of Weird
Al is tired of life.

339
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:39,323
Look at that lighthouse.

340
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:43,392
That's the ultimate expression of
phallocentric technocracy,

341
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:45,162
violating Mother Sky.

342
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:47,593
I thought they were just
tall so boats could see them.

343
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:48,332
No, Marge.

344
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:50,661
Everything penis-shaped is bad.

345
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,270
Look, a wedding !

346
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,590
Slavery is alive and
well in Springfield.

347
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,530
You oppose marriage ?

348
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,743
Marge, marriage has
oppressed women for centuries.

349
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:03,920
But, Steffan,

350
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,280
I would like to get married someday.

351
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,730
Oh, Marge, it's statements like that
make people say women are stupid.

352
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,432
It's statements like that that...

353
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,423
are mean !

354
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:14,913
Well, it may sound mean,

355
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:17,010
but I'm just trying
to help you evolve.

356
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,743
Oh, evolve yourself,
Professor Jerk !

357
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:22,532
Or should I say,
Associate Professor Jerk !

358
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:30,193
I only got denied tenure because
my department head is an idiot !

359
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:33,670
Der, duh, what did
you say about me ?

360
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,313
I'm sorry, Professor Moose.

361
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:38,090
You're about to get your PhD...

362
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,133
Pound Head Down.

363
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:54,461
<i>Spread yellow gunk
on my pancake heart</i>

364
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:57,963
<i>Country-churned girl
in my grocery cart...</i>

365
00:17:57,963 --> 00:18:00,432
Could he be singing about me ?

366
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:03,842
He is !

367
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,083
<i>I paid for her dreams</i>

368
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,013
<i>She taught me to cry</i>

369
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:09,522
<i>Like watery knives</i>

370
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:11,793
<i>Like rain from my eyes</i>

371
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:17,320
<i>I can't believe you're not mine</i>

372
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:24,610
<i>I can't believe you're not mine</i>

373
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:26,753
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

374
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,601
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

375
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,551
<i>Mar-ge-rine</i>

376
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,980
<i>Mar-ge-rine !</i>

377
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:41,891
<i>Mar-ge-rine !</i>

378
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:45,680
He loves me so much
after what I did to him.

379
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:51,072
We interrupt this "Bleak Block"
to bring you a breaking story.

380
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:54,281
Grunge trailblazer
Sadgasm have broken up.

381
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:58,362
Reclusive front man
Homer Simpson has

382
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,611
holed himself up in his
mansion, as rumors swirled

383
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:03,201
about an out-of-control
narcotics addiction.

384
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,973
This is Kurt Loder reporting from...

385
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:05,773
the '90s.

386
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:08,793
No, narcotics !

387
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:16,681
Oh, my God, you're a junkie !

388
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,052
I need it...

389
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:19,693
I'm getting you off this stuff.

390
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,100
But I need it !

391
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,633
No, you don't !

392
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:29,590
<i>Unfortunately, as I later learned,</i>

393
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,783
<i>that wasn't heroin.</i>

394
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:31,823
<i>It was insulin.</i>

395
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:34,293
Homer really did
need those injections.

396
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:37,982
I had become diabetic from
drinking too many Frappuccinos.

397
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:42,052
Homie, I got so caught
up in the world of college

398
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:44,833
that I forgot how
important your love was.

399
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,261
Can you find it in your
heart to take me back ?

400
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:48,331
Of course.

401
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:52,110
The thing that stood between us
the '90s is almost over.

402
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,850
You're right.

403
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,110
But I'm worried about
what's on the horizon:

404
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,450
reality shows, Britney Spears,

405
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,151
the suspicious number
of home runs being hit...

406
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:03,260
At least we know there'll never be
a president worse than Bill Clinton.

407
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,740
Imagine, lying in a
deposition in a civil lawsuit.

408
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,290
That's the worst sin a
president could commit.

409
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,401
There'll never be
a worse president.

410
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,142
Never.

411
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:13,013
Never.

412
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:15,221
<i>With the '90s drawing to a close,</i>

413
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,313
<i>and the Sydney Olympics
to look forward to,</i>

414
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:19,000
<i>our love rekindled.</i>

415
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,620
<i>And one moonlight night,</i>

416
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,750
<i>I finally had fun at
a mini-golf course.</i>

417
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:29,010
<i>Homer, stop !</i>

418
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,841
You don't have to tell
the kids everything !

419
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:33,772
What did I miss ?
How did it end ?

420
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,192
You two ever get back together ?

421
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,790
Yep, that professor couldn't
keep me and Marge apart.

422
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,881
I mean, unless he had been
a little nicer at the beach.

423
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:45,291
Well, that professor did
teach me one good lesson:

424
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,802
Homie is where my heart is.

425
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:50,893
And once we were back together,

426
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:54,083
I was to happy ever to grunge again.

427
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:56,911
Townies.
