00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,512
The Simpsons S19E20 (KABF13)
--- Season Finale ---
All About Lisa

2
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:33,573
Welcome to the 38th annual
Springfield Showbiz Awards.

3
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:36,577
There are more stars here tonight
than you can see in the sky,

4
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,682
thanks to light pollution.

5
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,745
Here comes
the magnificently-mammaried,

6
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:42,765
mistress of midnight movie
mayhem, Booberella.

7
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:44,854
The twins look happy tonight.

8
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:46,446
And what have we here?

9
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:50,142
It's ventriloquist Arthur Crandall
and his walnut wingman, Gabbo.

10
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:52,000
- Gabbo!
- Gabbo, over here!

11
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,990
Get a job, parasites.

12
00:00:56,564 --> 00:00:59,798
We now come to our final award,
"Entertainer of the Year."

13
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,249
An award so prestigious,
that it recently won

14
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:05,973
the "Award of the Year" award
at the 2007 Awardy Awards.

15
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,301
This year's nominees are
an eclectic group.

16
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:10,401
This distinguished-looking
gentleman

17
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:12,542
is a highly-respected actor.

18
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:14,541
It's not important what he says,

19
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:16,423
or who he's a parody of.

20
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:19,113
Only one person
here really matters...

21
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,523
the recipient of this award.

22
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:23,193
No, it is not me.

23
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:26,190
I am but your humble narrator
in this tale of fame,

24
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:27,780
betrayal and coin collecting.

25
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,373
But more about that later.

26
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:30,593
Nor is it him.

27
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:31,810
Nor him.

28
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:33,061
Nor ham.

29
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:36,170
No, tonight is about her.

30
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,322
This year's award goes to...

31
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,891
Lisa Simpson.

32
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:44,512
Surprised?

33
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,300
Let me start at the beginning,

34
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:49,642
and tell you a little bit
about Lisa.

35
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:52,860
In fact, All About Lisa.

36
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:58,671
And now, in honor
of Krusty's 4,000th episode,

37
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:01,582
put your hands together
for Drew Carey.

38
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:03,133
Thank you.

39
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:04,321
Thank you.

40
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:07,621
Wow, 4,000 episodes.

41
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:10,761
It seems like just yesterday
Krusty stole his first joke from me.

42
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:13,080
Seriously, though, I remember watching

43
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:14,260
him as a kid, and I thought,

44
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,083
"I could do that, and I'm a kid."

45
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:20,080
What I love about Krusty is,
he's always on...

46
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,862
but to find out what,
you've gotta test his pee.

47
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:23,972
Pee!

48
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:26,783
Seriously,
test his pee.

49
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:28,550
He's a danger
to the community.

50
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:32,121
And now I give you a man
whose act will never grow old,

51
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:34,160
because it started out that way:

52
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:37,931
Krusty the Clown.

53
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:40,641
Thank you.

54
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:43,780
I never thought I'd make
it past 400 episodes,

55
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,573
what with the drinking and the smoking

56
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,503
and the fact that I'm
just not that good.

57
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:51,052
It seems like just yesterday
that we started the show,

58
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:53,303
with the original Krusketeers.

59
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:58,971
Who's our favorite TV clown
who likes to clown around?

60
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:00,040
K-R-U...

61
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,161
S-T-Y...

62
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:04,751
Hey! Quit steppin' on my solo,
ya creepy little show monkeys!

63
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:11,402
And here they are today.

64
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,543
Come on out, Krusketeers.

65
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,033
I'm Jesse.

66
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,022
C.J.

67
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:27,891
You owe me money, Krusty.

68
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,623
I did time for you, clown.

69
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,732
Hard time.

70
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:34,501
Isn't that great.
They all came back to see me.

71
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,282
That's right.
All except the successful ones.

72
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:39,162
Now guess what, kids?

73
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,840
The Krusty Show is searching
for a new Krusketeer.

74
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,600
It could be any of you.

75
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:47,062
As long you're willing to sign

76
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,813
a 20 year personal services contract

77
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:51,293
where I get 99%
of all your earnings.

78
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:53,823
I am so gonna try out for that.

79
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,062
Me, too.
But I hope you get it.

80
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,720
No, I hope you get it.

81
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:59,853
Well, I really
hope you get it.

82
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,013
Yeah, I hope I get it, too.
Later.

83
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:05,522
For a second there,
he hoped I got it.

84
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,523
A great man once observed:

85
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:22,063
"90% of success is
showing up on time."

86
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:23,622
Sorry I'm four hours late.

87
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:26,573
Now let's pick a Krusketeer!

88
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:43,190
For my first impression...

89
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:46,461
I'm a lantern fish.

90
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,531
Now I'm a jack-o'-lantern.

91
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:56,803
E.T.

92
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,162
B.E.T.

93
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:01,051
Yay, Bart!

94
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,823
My son's a good-for-somethin'!

95
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,253
Uh, yeah, okay.

96
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,133
You kids were all terrific.

97
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:10,323
I wish I could make each
of you a Krusketeer,

98
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:12,591
but we only have enough
money for one.

99
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:14,121
Plus, I don't really want to.

100
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:17,311
So after much consideration
of all your talents,

101
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:20,013
my new Krusketeer is...

102
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,351
What's your kid's name again?

103
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,030
Nelson Muntz.

104
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,942
Wilbur Mudd.

105
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:25,901
That's me.

106
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,013
- Here's Mudd in your eye.
- Ow!

107
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:32,500
I can't believe I lost.

108
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:37,372
That's not fair
Bart was great.

109
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:39,291
Hey, Krusty,...

110
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,082
you're making a huge mistake
not hiring my brother.

111
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:43,481
Why don't you hire them both?

112
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:46,281
It won't cost you anything
you could call Bart an intern.

113
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:48,643
In fact, the intern thing could open up

114
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,072
a whole new world of free labor for you.

115
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:52,941
Did you know the Discovery Channel

116
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:54,922
doesn't have a single paid employee?

117
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,650
Hm. Okay, kid,
you've convinced me.

118
00:05:57,655 --> 00:05:59,231
To make Bart a Krusketeer?

119
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:01,902
Hell, no.
To make you my new intern.

120
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:03,362
You're a real go-getter.

121
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:04,921
Now go get me
my dry-cleaning,

122
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:06,620
which is my code word
for scotch.

123
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,021
And get me a scotch,

124
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,910
which is my code word
for my bookie.

125
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,773
Also, go get
my dry-cleaning.

126
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:14,272
- Wha... but...
- Wha, but, wha, wha, wha, but.

127
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:15,620
What are you standing
around for?

128
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:18,271
I wish I was paying you,
so I could dock your salary.

129
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,872
Lisa didn't know it then,

130
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:25,553
but she had just dipped her
toe into the business of show.

131
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:30,430
And it is a business, as you shall
find out in about three seconds.

132
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:32,221
Two... one...

133
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,971
Over the years, show business

134
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,980
has been home to scoundrels and saints,

135
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:40,281
thespians and harlequins,
Abbots and Costelli.

136
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:42,702
And they all had one thing
in common...

137
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:45,103
an underpaid assistant.

138
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:48,711
Cancel my 1:00. Move my 2:00
to 1:00 and cancel that.

139
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:51,940
Oh, and go to my joke file
and make all the"Sophia Lorens"

140
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:53,311
into "Lindsay Lohans."

141
00:06:53,317 --> 00:06:54,732
So do a global change?

142
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:56,500
What am I, Al Gore?
Just do it.

143
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,590
What are you lookin' at?

144
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:07,140
I'm just trying
to hit my marks.

145
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,058
And I don't?
Is that what you're saying?

146
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:11,779
No, no. I think you're
a consummate pro.

147
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,672
Oh, so now you're judging me.

148
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:14,881
Well, what do ya think of this:

149
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,083
you're fired.

150
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:19,392
Yeah, well, my mom says
you're a selfish lover.

151
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,333
I know what I want
and I get it.

152
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,612
I'll trash you in my memoirs!

153
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:27,760
Pay attention you'll be writing
my memoirs.

154
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:29,592
I'll never last here.

155
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,152
Chin up, little gofer.

156
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,432
You can succeed with Krusty.

157
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:36,803
A few hints: Always carry a cigar
in case he asks.

158
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:38,101
Never meet his gaze.

159
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:41,761
And if he mentions
Mitzi Gaynor, and he will,

160
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:45,261
for God's sake act like
you know who she is.

161
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,221
I got pastrami stuck in my teeth,

162
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:49,111
and that's everybody's problem.

163
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:50,480
Who's got floss?

164
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:58,873
Here you go, Krusty.

165
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:04,202
Nicely done, kid.

166
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,111
You're the best thing that's happened
to this business since...

167
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:08,442
Mitzi Gaynor?

168
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,682
I was gonna say
"cheap Korean animation," but sure.

169
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:15,480
I can't believe you're working
for Krusty and I'm not.

170
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,402
I know everything
about that clown.

171
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:19,010
Favorite blintz: blueberry.

172
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:21,871
Favorite horse in the 2004
Belmont: Smarty Jones.

173
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:23,461
Krusty lost a bundle and had to

174
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:24,951
endorse baby wipes in Norway.

175
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:26,250
Which I have a case of.

176
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,252
Krusty klovnen
baby visker!

177
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:32,462
Stupid Krusty...I hate this...

178
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:35,221
Bart's having girl trouble.
You better go talk to him.

179
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,621
It's clown trouble.

180
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,373
That's your responsibility.

181
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:41,573
I thought I was in charge of
bedtime stories and pets dying.

182
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:43,351
Yeah, well,
we're adding clowns.

183
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,881
Oh! Fine.

184
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:48,172
But you just bought yourself "ear piercing"
and "strange new feelings."

185
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,192
Fine.

186
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:52,093
Lisa's got school,
career, posture.

187
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,011
Why did she have to
steal Krusty from me?

188
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,780
Son, the healthy
thing is to get rid of

189
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,312
everything that reminds
you of Krusty...

190
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:01,532
which appears to be everything.

191
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:04,231
Hey, maybe we should
give Lisa this room.

192
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:06,251
You know she works
for Krusty now.

193
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:09,571
Okay, here's my offer:

194
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:11,691
All this prim
Krusty merchandise

195
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:14,410
for that copy of "Radioactive
Man vs. Muhammad Ali."

196
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:15,512
My counter offer:

197
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:18,300
"Radioactive Man Meets
the Kansas City Royals."

198
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:20,501
How about "Radioactive Man vs.

199
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,193
Restless Leg Syndrome"?

200
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,373
Let us try a different tack.

201
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:26,413
Are you interested
in coin collecting?

202
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,950
- Am I?! No.
- Hmm.

203
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,362
Wait, wait, wait.

204
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,781
I will start you off with
this bicentennial quarter

205
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:36,992
and I will throw in
my man scrunchie.

206
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:45,753
Uh, we'll stick with the coins.

207
00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:49,433
Whoa, nice.

208
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,352
Everything in its place,

209
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,791
nothin' festering
inside of nothin'.

210
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:56,370
You've alphabetized
my book collection.

211
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:59,513
I've never had such
a great assistant.

212
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:02,713
I'm gonna call you
"The Goy Wonder."

213
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,713
Because I don't
remember your name.

214
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:07,862
All right, time to fill
these slots with coins.

215
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:09,812
Specific coins?

216
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:12,011
This hobby sucks.

217
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,443
Son, all hobbies suck.

218
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,323
But if you keep at it,
you might find at the end

219
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:20,351
that you've managed to
kill some precious time.

220
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,303
Wow, I never thought
of it like that.

221
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,081
Do you want to collect coins
with your old man?

222
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:26,570
You bet I do!

223
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:27,991
To your mother's purse.

224
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:36,572
Take A penny
Leave a penny

225
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,443
Toll Booth

226
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:51,911
Luck O' The Irish
Wishing well

227
00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:55,652
What's you're doin' here ?
That's just my well !

228
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:58,000
You don't like swearing
prayers around my well!

229
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:58,650
Oh, yeah?

230
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:00,561
Well, what do you think
of them apples?

231
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,453
I'll take all of ya.

232
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:08,293
No, don't put that...
Oh, no, I'll never gets out !

233
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:11,980
Slide in the 1863
Confederate half dime

234
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:14,602
and every slot is full.

235
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:18,982
This is the first book I've ever finished
reading or pushing things into.

236
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,752
What the...?
We missed one!

237
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:26,443
"The Inverted Double-struck
Penny" or "Kissing Lincolns'

238
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:29,690
was mistakenly minted
in December of 1917,

239
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:32,680
when a brief glimpse of a woman's
ankle caused three days

240
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:34,772
of rioting at the Philadelphia Mint."

241
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,292
The one on the left
looks into it,

242
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:39,160
but the one on the right is
just experimenting.

243
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,641
Son, we are getting
that coin.

244
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,403
Here I am,
walking the plank.

245
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,783
I wish this mean pirate wasn't
poking me with his sword!

246
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:51,331
- Where's the chimp?
- Mr. Teeny's not here.

247
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:53,750
- He's stuck in traffic.
- Oh, what do I do?

248
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,863
I can't ad lib
to save my life.

249
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:01,342
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of fun.

250
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,483
- What are you doing, kid?
- My job: making you look good.

251
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:08,722
Oh, yeah, right.
So, what be your name, matey?

252
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:11,913
Long John Seltzer!

253
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,561
The laughter swept
over her like a wave,

254
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:27,963
enveloping her in its
intoxicating embrace.

255
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:31,302
The next week, Krusty went
to his Lake Tahoe retreat

256
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:33,550
** for some R and R.

257
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:36,251
But he was about
to get an unexpected visit

258
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,282
from a third and fourth R,

259
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:40,580
Ron Rabinowitz.

260
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:43,260
Krusty, I've been your
agent for 45 years.

261
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:46,400
I am telling you, watch out
for this Lisa Simpson character.

262
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:48,323
She has got a taste
for Lady Laughter,

263
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,751
and she will step right over
a certain clown to get it.

264
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:52,412
Which clown?
Chuckles?

265
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:53,693
Professor Nitwit?

266
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,792
No, you!

267
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:57,840
No Yu,
the Chinese Clown?

268
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:02,113
Oh, great one, Krusty.

269
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,511
But seriously,
you're in real trouble here.

270
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,172
Yeah?

271
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:07,301
What do you mean?

272
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:10,403
If there was a rehearsal
for the network,

273
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,743
I would've been told by my...

274
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:15,451
...assistant!

275
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:16,841
Well, where is he?

276
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,850
I don't know,
I guess he forgot.

277
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:21,351
But people seemed
to like me last week.

278
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,023
You stood in
for Mr. Teeny.

279
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,690
How'd you like to stand in
for Krusty?

280
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:28,321
Oh, well, it's one thing
to fill in for a monkey.

281
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:30,002
But a comedy legend?

282
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,420
I wouldn't dream of it.

283
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:33,412
I respect that.
Cancel the run-through.

284
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,933
Okay, I'll do the monologue.

285
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,001
Evening, Mr. Krusty.

286
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:40,842
- Great show last...
- Sorry, I can't act like you matter!

287
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,140
Have no fear,
the star is here!

288
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,622
Shh!
We're working!

289
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:51,842
Huh?

290
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,612
So the centipede says:
"I'm goin'! I'm goin'!

291
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:56,921
I'm just putting on my shoes!"

292
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:01,580
Now, that's well-performed comedy!

293
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,420
Oh, my God.

294
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:05,963
Everything you said
came true, Ron.

295
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:06,920
Uh, Ron?

296
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:10,611
So you'll come to the agency tomorrow and
I'll introduce you to the whole team, okay?

297
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:11,992
You like egg white omelets?

298
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:14,182
I'll be waiting.
You're a good girl.

299
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:18,033
I've been replaced by
an eight-year-old.

300
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,232
I can be eight!

301
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:21,591
La, la, la, la.

302
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,611
I'm eight years old.

303
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:33,863
Krusty, you've learned that fame,
that fickle beauty,

304
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:35,910
can leave you when
you need it most.

305
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,780
And Lisa had a lesson
to learn as well.

306
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:40,781
A lesson about...
You, there!

307
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:42,892
- Cut that out!
- Sorry, sorry.

308
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:48,991
Thank you, folks.
You've been a great audience.

309
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,352
I'm gonna keep this forever!

310
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:57,263
All of Springfield fell head
over heels for Lisa.

311
00:14:57,507 --> 00:14:58,471
Here she comes.

312
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:01,643
Quick, switch from internal
monologue to external dialogue!

313
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:04,493
Shall we visit the commissary
to toast your success?

314
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:05,442
Yeah, sure, Mel.

315
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,943
Let me just wave one more
good-bye to my fans.

316
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:30,090
While applause rained down on Lisa,
poor Krusty found himself parched.

317
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:34,270
It's 3:32 a.m.,
which means it's time for

318
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,023
Last Gasp with Krusty the Clown!

319
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,373
Brought to you by Nappien,

320
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:43,143
Nok-em-Out and
Nok-em-Out Jr. for kids.

321
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:47,191
Tonight's guest is local bully,
Jimbo Jones?

322
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:53,092
This is the lowest
I've ever sunk

323
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:55,811
and I once made out
with a blow-up doll

324
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:06,582
Sorry you broke up
with me now Cindy?

325
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:09,533
One of these has got to be that
smooching Lincoln penny.

326
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,582
Nope. Nope.
Dime. Button.

327
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:13,080
- Pepperoni slice.
- Wait!

328
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,753
This is a classic
1978 Pizza Hut!

329
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:21,061
Mmm... terrible.

330
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:23,250
Nope. Nope. Nope.

331
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:26,453
Son, coin collecting's
a lot like life.

332
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:29,561
It stopped being fun
a long time ago.

333
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,772
But unlike life, I have
a solution for this.

334
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,173
Gavelby's
Auction house.

335
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,073
Going once, going twice...

336
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,873
sold to Mr. Burns!

337
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,412
I've won every coin.

338
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,873
But I feel strangely empty.

339
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:43,953
Ooh, there's another coin.
That should do it.

340
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:48,771
Our last item up for bid is a mint
condition 1917 "Kissing Lincoln" penny.

341
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:51,193
Okay, boy, this is it.
Five dollars!

342
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,970
- $500.
- Five dollars cash!

343
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:58,252
Sir, the promise of cash
is not an enticement.

344
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:00,183
The current bid is $500.

345
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:03,813
Do I hear a counter bid?
Going once, going twice...Dad?

346
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:05,860
- $501!
- $10 million.

347
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:08,382
- Objection, your honor.
- Sir, I am not a judge.

348
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:12,532
But, um, overruled.
Sold to Mr. Burns for $10 million!

349
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:20,692
I paid a pretty penny for this
pretty penny, but it was worth it.

350
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,583
Mr. Burns, my son and
I have been collecting coins.

351
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:28,331
It's really brought
us closer together.

352
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:32,091
That penny you bought tonight
would mean the world to him.

353
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:36,263
Yes, but the problem is,
if you had it, I wouldn't.

354
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,791
You see difficulty.

355
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:39,720
Mmm. Yeah.

356
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,122
I'll tell you what, at least help
me buy the boy a gumball.

357
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,820
- Do you have change for a nickel?
- Oh, of course.

358
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,471
Smithers, step on it!

359
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,542
I only gave him four cents
for that nickel.

360
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:54,420
Monty Burns wins a...

361
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,341
And... done.

362
00:17:57,357 --> 00:18:00,812
Now, let's put it on a shelf
and never look at it again.

363
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:03,122
You got it, boy.

364
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:07,273
And so, bonded by love
and larceny,

365
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:09,763
father and son got dressed,

366
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,622
had a minor disagreement...

367
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:12,593
You little...

368
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,351
...patched things up...

369
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,682
Sorry, Dad.

370
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:20,193
...and went downtown,

371
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:22,121
where they watched proudly,

372
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:25,003
as Lisa accepted her award.

373
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,233
Lisa, before you walk away
from this venerable hall and

374
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,042
into the arms of your adoring fans,
may I have a moment?

375
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:41,100
Well, I do owe you everything.
Make it quick.

376
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:45,462
Behold your fellow winners
of the Entertainer of the Year Award.

377
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,642
Hmm.
I don't recognize any of them.

378
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:49,453
And why should you?

379
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:52,062
He appears nightly
on Broadway,

380
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:54,703
selling combs and mints
in the men's room.

381
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,540
She was fired after
a bad rehearsal

382
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,913
from Homeboys In Outer Space.

383
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:02,201
And perhaps
the saddest one of all,

384
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,692
he graced stages from
London to Los Angeles.

385
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:08,213
When he played
Biff in Death Of A Salesman,

386
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:11,930
every woman in the audience
wished they were Hap.

387
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:16,482
But that was before he...
"took the bone."

388
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:20,552
Melvin Van Horne.

389
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,972
Sideshow Mel?!

390
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:24,183
It's you!

391
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:28,022
How could this happen to you,
to all these wonderful performers?

392
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:30,502
Applause is an addiction,

393
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:33,760
like heroin or checking your e-mail.

394
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:37,353
Once you have a taste,
you'll do anything to get more.

395
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:39,603
Don't end up like these people.

396
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,703
Don't end up like...

397
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:43,412
me.

398
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,870
I need to get out
while I still can.

399
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:49,250
Thank you, Mel.

400
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:51,370
Everyone, wait!

401
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:53,790
Um, there's someone
I forgot to thank,

402
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:55,132
and he's here tonight.

403
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:57,533
Krusty, will you come up
on stage, please?

404
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:58,752
What do you want?

405
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:01,303
You've already taken
everything I care about.

406
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:02,142
Really?

407
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:04,042
So what else is in the news?

408
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:06,700
This just in:
I don't give a crap.

409
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,682
I'm trying to set you up
for laughs.

410
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,872
Trying to set me up
with a giraffe?

411
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:13,483
Oh, right.

412
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:16,430
You guys know about giraffes...
long legs, big neck.

413
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:17,783
Here comes the zinger.

414
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:18,950
Speaking of necks,

415
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:21,812
my girlfriend is
a real pain in mine.

416
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:23,940
She crashed her car in
to mine and said,

417
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:26,440
"Look, honey, we have a hybrid."

418
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,492
Timely.

419
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:33,351
By giving everything away,

420
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,482
she was able to keep the only
thing that mattered:

421
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,150
her dignity.

422
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:42,062
God, how I envy her.

423
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:45,930
Ooh, I think I'm in love!

424
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,431
Krusty, please.

425
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,901
My wife is giving birth
as we speak!

426
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:52,120
Just four more takes.
Come on.

427
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:54,330
No!

428
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:56,480
Oh, Krusty, have a heart.

429
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:01,323
