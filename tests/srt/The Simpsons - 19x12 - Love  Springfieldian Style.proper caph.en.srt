1
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:08,672
The Simpsons S19E12 (KABF05)
Love, Springfieldian Style

2
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,633
<i>L is for the way you look at me</i>

3
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:36,166
<i>O is for the only one I see</i>

4
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:42,560
<i>V is very, very extraordinary</i>

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,696
Sweet on you

6
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,067
Release the hounds

7
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:46,529
<i>E is even more than
anyone that you adore</i>

8
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,193
I can't wait to see my
Valentine's Day surprise.

9
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:53,026
Good, 'cause I'm parking
at it right now.

10
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:55,990
A carnival?

11
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:58,156
What's so romantic
about this?

12
00:00:58,151 --> 00:00:59,520
- Bye!
- See you later!

13
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,793
For the next two hours,
we'll be kid-free.

14
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,093
It'll be just like the time
we lost them at the mall.

15
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,673
That was the best
Christmas ever.

16
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,202
Ah, the Tunnel of Love.

17
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,681
Nothing gets a woman
in your arms faster

18
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:18,452
than scary robots
and simulated privacy.

19
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:34,670
Marge!
Look over there!

20
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,203
Mom and Dad are in there.

21
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:42,221
Want to ruin
their fun?

22
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:44,622
Bart, no, it's
Valentine's Day.

23
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:45,470
Okay...

24
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:47,002
but if Dad kisses
Mom too much,

25
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,710
a stork will lay an angel
egg in her tummy,

26
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:49,831
and the next thing you know,

27
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:51,832
we find a baby brother
in the cabbage patch!

28
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:53,021
Here's a thumbnail sketch:

29
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:56,330
In the first place, you...

30
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,682
Do whatever you want.

31
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,193
I'm getting a candy apple.

32
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,461
Due to a classic Jell-O prank,

33
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:22,220
this ride has been disabled.

34
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:26,231
Please remain in your boats.

35
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:27,872
You will be charged
for the extra time.

36
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:32,763
This is a terrible
Valentine's Day.

37
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,602
What if I told you
some of the greatest

38
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,591
love stories of all time?

39
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:39,742
"Romeo and Juliet"?

40
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:40,933
"Arthur and Guinevere"?

41
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:41,981
Brangelina?

42
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:46,193
Even better, a tale of...

43
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:47,122
One moment.

44
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:53,403
A tale of two young
outlaws in love.

45
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:56,443
<i>They were the Bonnie and Clyde
of their day.</i>

46
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:59,053
<i>Their names were
Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

47
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,253
Miss Bonnie,

48
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:02,912
might I escort you
to the picture show?

49
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,982
I swear I won't misbehave.

50
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,400
Then no, thank you.

51
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:07,922
This is Texas,

52
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:10,341
future home of
Akeem Olajuwon!

53
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,612
And I've got dreams
as big as he will be.

54
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:14,091
I want action!

55
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,311
Action, eh?

56
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:19,650
Clyde Barrow,

57
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:21,032
local bad boy.

58
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:22,251
Bonnie Parker.

59
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,261
Say, if you're so bad,

60
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:27,920
you could go stick up that
feed store over yonder.

61
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:29,471
Hmm.

62
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:30,820
Unless...

63
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:32,541
you're chicken.

64
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,451
No one calls me "chicken" without

65
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:36,800
goading me into
doing something stupid!

66
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,251
Ya idjit!

67
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,570
You could've had anything
you want for free!

68
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,432
You're a co-owner!

69
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:50,773
I'll see you at Thanksgiving!

70
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:55,692
Oats!

71
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:58,022
Texas caviar!

72
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,512
Good times.

73
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:07,192
Finally.
Some excitement.

74
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:10,520
<i>Wow, I guess violence
is her only turn-on.</i>

75
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:11,502
<i>Well, there might be others,</i>

76
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:13,232
<i>but I'm too lazy to
figure out what they are.</i>

77
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:14,611
<i>So violence it is!</i>

78
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:18,372
Oh, there's somethin'
this kissin' is missin'.

79
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:26,590
Oh, Clyde, you know
just what a girl likes.

80
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,432
Why are you shooting at us?

81
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,780
We cooperated fully!

82
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:34,952
It's a sex thing!

83
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,013
Say no more!

84
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:38,941
Hey, can I give you folks a lift?

85
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,623
Yes, to a series of banks,
up and down the state.

86
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:42,203
Banks?

87
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,051
Well, deposit yourselves in a seat

88
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:45,632
because you've earned my interest!

89
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:52,470
Dateline: Texas.

90
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:55,982
<i>A nation, crippled by unemployment
and bored by Seabiscuit,</i>

91
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,752
<i>embraces two unlikely folk heroes.</i>

92
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,861
<i>Bonnie and Clyde souvenirs
are flying off the shelves,</i>

93
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:07,753
<i>and the Dust Bowl duo has
inspired their own radio show.</i>

94
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:10,302
Uh, Bonnie, where did you
put the money we stole?

95
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,642
I filed it under "G."

96
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:12,522
Under "G"?

97
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:14,102
Why would you
file it under "G"?

98
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,512
Because gee, it's swell
to have all that money.

99
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:17,202
I see.

100
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:21,840
Their notoriety has reached
the highest levels of government

101
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:24,690
To deal with the menace
of Bonnie and Clyde,

102
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:29,461
I am recalling all our air
defense forces from Pearl Harbor.

103
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:33,601
Somebody please remind
me to move them back.

104
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:37,053
I would be honored to perform that duty.

105
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:38,560
They're outlaws?!

106
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:40,811
I've been played
like a pair of spoons!

107
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,260
Well, who am I to judge?

108
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,240
It's the Depression, money's tight...

109
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:46,751
<i>Anyone who sees this
unmarried couple should...</i>

110
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:47,761
Unmarried?!

111
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,573
That's it.
I'm turning them in.

112
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:50,953
Hey, keep it down, will ya?

113
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,120
The part where all my men
get killed is coming up.

114
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,173
Listen, Sheriff, I can help
you take down Bonnie and Clyde.

115
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:58,933
After the racially
insensitive cartoon.

116
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,670
One taco coming up.

117
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,383
Even I'm offended by this,

118
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,542
and I'm a fat Southern sheriff.

119
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,083
Um...

120
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:26,683
the battery seems
to be dead.

121
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:29,393
I'll get some help by
hiding in that bush.

122
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:31,993
Come on, shoot! Shoot!

123
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:33,992
Oh! Not me!

124
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,111
Bonnie, I love you.

125
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:39,031
Will you marry me?

126
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:40,270
I don't know.

127
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,892
I guess I'm just looking
for a little more excitement.

128
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:46,182
Okay, but if you change your mind,
you know where I'm at.

129
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:48,780
Mm, I think we should see other people.

130
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:50,270
Say, Officer,

131
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,300
I like how you handle that gun.

132
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:52,992
Thanks.

133
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,190
I like the way
you take a bullet.

134
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:57,392
Hey, back off!
She's my girl!

135
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:59,300
Damn, just my luck!

136
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,593
Cool. Now we're shooting the birds

137
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:05,282
that are pecking at the bodies.

138
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:14,200
So that's the end
of the story, huh?

139
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:15,182
You'd think so, but...

140
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,540
We want to hear a story.

141
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,483
A story suitable for children.

142
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:24,191
All right.

143
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,940
This is a story of two
dogs with a love so strong,

144
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:30,136
no hose could separate them.

145
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:32,640
I call it Shady and the Vamp.

146
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:44,593
She's so beautiful.

147
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,752
Imagine what she looks
like with her collar off.

148
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:50,912
A mutt like you could never
get a fancy dame like that.

149
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,193
Even her fleas have more class than you.

150
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:59,661
Lady Bitington, will you be summering
in the hindquarters again this year?

151
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:00,823
Oh, no!

152
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:03,952
Chompy and I have taken
a cottage in West Leg.

153
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,722
It's where all the fleas are fleeing.

154
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:10,802
Watch and learn.

155
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,482
You know, heaven must have
left its doggie door open

156
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,762
because you are one...

157
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:30,921
Oh, you poor thing!

158
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,122
Is there anything I can do?

159
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:38,521
You can have dinner with me.

160
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:39,900
All right.

161
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:41,650
But keep your nose
where I can see it.

162
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:43,071
Can you bring
a friend for me?

163
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,203
I like those chicks
with them head cones

164
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:48,023
when they start talking, you
can drop below the horizon.

165
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,733
Oh, Shady, you on a date, huh?

166
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:02,073
How's it-a goin'?

167
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:05,362
You say it's goin' kinda-a rough?

168
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,550
That is precisely
what I'm saying.

169
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:08,843
Sit down. Sit down.

170
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,251
I bring-a you a
nice-a bowl of Chianti.

171
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,412
Let go! Let go!

172
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,140
No. You let go of the spaghetti!

173
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:38,412
You're pretty feisty
for an upper-class bitch.

174
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:43,043
Oh, I like that you use the
technical termfor a female dog.

175
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,080
Run, run!

176
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:47,163
The health inspector man,
he's-a here!

177
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,521
Why didn't I listen to Mama?

178
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:54,131
"Serve-a food to humans!"

179
00:09:57,577 --> 00:10:00,780
I have to admit,
that was exciting.

180
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:03,022
And I am in heat.

181
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:04,411
That's the safe time, right?

182
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,091
Oh, the safest.

183
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:17,761
That was the most...

184
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,852
wonderful night of my life.

185
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,390
That's odd.

186
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:24,020
I'm never sickin
the morning.

187
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,162
What could it be?

188
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:25,971
Oh, uh...

189
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:27,830
Is that a foxhunt I hear?

190
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:35,230
Shady!

191
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:40,270
I haven't seen Shady in weeks.

192
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:45,610
Any minute now

193
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:49,592
He'll scamper through
that doggie door

194
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,270
Any minute now

195
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:55,252
I'll be the dog
she's lookin' for

196
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:57,243
Any minute now

197
00:10:57,327 --> 00:11:00,823
You'll be stuck
with her brood

198
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,722
Any minute now

199
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:07,542
This pooch will know she's screwed

200
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:12,451
My heart tells
me to trust him

201
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:16,691
But your head knows
he's a hound

202
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,763
I want to do the right thing

203
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:23,701
Come on, with all this
high-class tail around?

204
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,442
Any minute now

205
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:30,390
Our girl will make
a brand-new start

206
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:31,932
Yesss!

207
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:34,122
Any minute now

208
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:38,533
I won't care that
he broke my heart

209
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:45,340
Any minute now.

210
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,471
- Where's our dad?
- We need Daddy!

211
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:53,200
- I want to go find Daddy!
- Where's Daddy?!

212
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:55,620
I don't wanna hear another
word about your father.

213
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,130
We gotta find our daddy.

214
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:12,280
Yeah, he's gotta teach
me how to lick my...

215
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:13,961
Oh, I figured it out.

216
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:14,812
You go ahead.

217
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:15,920
Come on!

218
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:17,733
- Oh, Shady!
- Oh, Shady!

219
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,482
- Shady!
- Shady!

220
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,350
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

221
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:23,852
- We need you, Daddy!
- Daddy!

222
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,401
Ah, got ya!

223
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:30,221
You strays are going
straight to the pound

224
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:32,960
where you're put to sleep...

225
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,532
by my boring stories.

226
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,770
And then you'll be killed!

227
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:44,012
Ah, looks like that problem
solved it self.

228
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:47,180
Now, uh, how 'bout you and
me sniff each other's butts?

229
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm just kiddin'.

230
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:51,411
Unless you want to.

231
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:59,381
Well, Looks like it's just
you and me again tonight.

232
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:13,681
Gawrsh, you can't kill me.

233
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,061
I'm half-human!

234
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,611
Look, I wear clothes!

235
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:17,870
I speak English!

236
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:20,022
I'm speaking it right now!

237
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,973
Sure you are.

238
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:31,753
You two are next.

239
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:33,400
Here's your last meal.

240
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:34,822
It's Cycle 5,

241
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:38,730
specially formulated for
dogs with five minutes to live.

242
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:43,543
Don't bite the hand
that kills ye!

243
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:48,431
Yay, Dad!

244
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:50,400
I knew you'd
come save us!

245
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,211
You two are going home,

246
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:53,911
and I'm coming with ya!

247
00:13:58,147 --> 00:13:59,971
This place is no picnic,

248
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:02,550
but it sure beats
working for Disney.

249
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:13,331
Look who we found!

250
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,771
Can I keep him?
Can we keep him?

251
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:16,461
Well, that depends.

252
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,171
Does he want to stay?

253
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:22,030
I want to stay, sit,
roll over and beg!

254
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,841
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please...!

255
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:28,003
All right,
we can be a family.

256
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,882
All four of us.

257
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,742
Uh... you know,

258
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,141
there are nine other puppies.

259
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:49,101
Even love is boring when
you're stuck in a tunnel of it.

260
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,852
Well, I've got a
Valentine's Day story!

261
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,222
It's about musicians
from a simpler time.

262
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:57,081
The era of The Brady Bunch,
Donny and Marie and...

263
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,310
Smash the flag

264
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,201
Burn the queen

265
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:03,953
Kick the sky

266
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:06,233
Antichrist!

267
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:11,541
Nancy, what are the odds?

268
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:14,151
You sign up for a
semester at U. of London;

269
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:16,453
then I immediately
do the same.

270
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,630
Yeah, I'm really lucky
you saved me

271
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:21,941
from meeting other people
and having new experiences.

272
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:27,052
What is that raw,
primo sound?

273
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,570
You can't go in there.

274
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,463
Our guide book
says not to!

275
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:33,793
<i>Hitler and her majesty</i>

276
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,461
<i>Sittin' in a tree</i>

277
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,961
<i>B-O-R-R-I-N-G!</i>

278
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,750
You rule, Sid Vicious!

279
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:42,141
You sicken me!

280
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,950
Why am I hittin' myself?

281
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:48,541
Why am I hittin' myself?

282
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:50,930
He's so uncompromising.

283
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:54,693
He'd never go for an uncool
spelling bee champion like me.

284
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,442
I've spelled "unrequited."

285
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:58,510
Now I know
what it means.

286
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:00,990
Yo. I got Duds, Chunks, Twix,

287
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:03,083
Cadbury's, any way you want to go.

288
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,313
Chocolate?

289
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,391
Nancy's too smart to
put that in her body.

290
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:10,572
It's only for losers,
like musicians and...

291
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:11,780
Musicians?!

292
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,333
That's my girlfriend.

293
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,902
Then I guess you'll be
paying for her chocolate.

294
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:18,721
Uh, okay.

295
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,422
Gotcha!

296
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,310
That's nice work,
Officer Otto.

297
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,412
Happy to be of service,
old bean.

298
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:25,340
<i>...cannon, neat, neat, neat</i>

299
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:27,921
<i>She can't afford a gun at all
Neat, neat, neat.</i>

300
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:33,411
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

301
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,061
<i>Night!</i>

302
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,142
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

303
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:37,771
<i>Night!</i>

304
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:40,651
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

305
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:41,251
<i>Night!</i>

306
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:51,242
Look, an American
nerd bird.

307
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:52,283
Nerd bird?

308
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:54,420
Would a nerd bird
have chocolate, huh?

309
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:55,793
Would a nerd bird?

310
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,321
Stop saying "nerd bird!"

311
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:58,813
Chocolate is boring.

312
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,542
Maybe I'll have a piece.

313
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:03,900
You know, just to see
how boring it is.

314
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,021
Oh, you're offering
me some?

315
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:11,902
Um... I guess I could.

316
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:14,053
I mean, I do it all the time!

317
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,381
- Oh!
- Oh!

318
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:23,063
Yup, it's boring all right.

319
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,292
How much more you got?

320
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,212
Lots.

321
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:27,721
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone?</i>

322
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,472
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

323
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:32,970
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

324
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:35,022
<i>You shouldn't've
fallen in love with?</i>

325
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,731
<i>I can't see much of a future</i>

326
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:41,632
<i>Unless we find out
what's to blame</i>

327
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,190
<i>What a shame</i>

328
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,590
<i>And we won't be
together much longer</i>

329
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:53,852
<i>Unless we realize
that we are the same</i>

330
00:17:57,697 --> 00:17:59,872
<i>Ever fallen in love
with someone</i>

331
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,543
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

332
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:05,291
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

333
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:08,100
<i>You shouldn't've fallen
in love with?</i>

334
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:15,330
We're gonna go out
and play our songs

335
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:18,263
like we've never played them
before: competently!

336
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,423
Where's Sid?

337
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:24,201
Sidney Sheldon Vicious!

338
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:26,750
Where you been,
chompin' Wonka?

339
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:32,300
When I hired a guy
named Sid Vicious,

340
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:35,571
I assumed it would be a 30-year
business relationship.

341
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:38,721
I told you to hire
Tom Responsible.

342
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,043
Slag off.

343
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:43,643
Here they are, all the way
from outside of Texas:

344
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:45,652
the Sex Pistols.

345
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:50,522
<i>Education's bollocks!</i>

346
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,901
<i>Bollocks!
America is bollocks!</i>

347
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,873
<i>Bollocks!
Politeness is bollocks!</i>

348
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,403
<i>Bollocks!
Bollocks!</i>

349
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,150
Can't reach me bass.

350
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,921
Me back is front ward!

351
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,891
Dang it, I wanted to hear
what else was bollocks!

352
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,601
You gobbed up our gig,
you git!

353
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:25,512
You leave Sid alone!
He doesn't need you!

354
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,422
He's quitting the band!

355
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:28,811
I'm doing what now?

356
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:30,071
You're quitting the band.

357
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:32,690
He's going solo, and I'm
gonna write his songs!

358
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:33,540
Yeah!

359
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,720
Hey, you guys want to
be in my new band?

360
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,740
Ho!! Just stop talking

361
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,071
and bang your head
against the wall!

362
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:42,782
I'm doing this
'cause I want to,

363
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:44,301
not 'cause she told me to.

364
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,673
Bang harder!

365
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:46,303
Yes, pet.

366
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:53,351
<i>'Cause love is the elixir</i>

367
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:56,001
<i>The potion of emotion</i>

368
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,543
<i>The world-saving fixer</i>

369
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:01,380
<i>The lotion of devotion.</i>

370
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,831
This song doesn't make
me feel angry at all.

371
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:06,641
If anything, it makes
my anger ebb!

372
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:11,313
Your music violates everything
punk stands for,

373
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,300
which is nothing!

374
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:14,341
You are no longer
welcome at CBGB's...

375
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,301
Comic Book Guy's Bar

376
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:17,972
Oh, forget those jerks.

377
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:20,973
Let's go back to the hotel
and get Snicker-faced.

378
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:24,191
Oh, I love you,
my Hershey hero.

379
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,682
And I love you,
Tootsie Roll.

380
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:39,293
Happy Valentine's Day

381
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,262
and shut your gob.
